<p>Top: Coin cell batteries going through electrical testing on galvanostat<br>Bottom: Black phosphorus anodes ready for battery assembly</p>



<p>Between Feb &#8211; May 2021, during my internship at my university&#8217;s renewable energy lab, I managed a research project investigating performance of sodium and black phosphorus as battery electrode materials. I was in charge of all steps of the process, from material and component preparation (like the electrodes above), to battery assembly, to electrical testing to determine voltage, capacity, and cyclability properties among others, to examining battery electrodes with Raman and X-ray diffraction spectroscopy, and then using that spectroscopy data to make changes to material prep and battery assembly in order to improve electrical properties. </p>



<p>I presented my progress weekly to one of the lab&#8217;s professors and communicated constantly with other researchers for advice and assistance. I also frequently read literature published on similar battery chemistries to find new ways to improve electrical performance.</p>



<p>I prepared the battery anodes by mixing black phosphorus with additives in specific ratios, then pressed the resultant layered material onto a wire mesh substrate (pictured above). These phosphorus anodes were dried for a day, and then moved into an argon glovebox, along with the other battery components for battery assembly. In the glovebox, I made the sodium metal cathode and assembled the batteries, then removed them from the glovebox and hooked them up for electrical testing, which could take a few days. After they were depleted to a certain voltage or had been cycled between two voltages a certain number of times, I identified specific cells which had the potential to produce interesting spectroscopy results and then prepared them for examination and used Raman or XrD spectroscopy machines and associated software to examine material properties &#8211; specifically, the degree of intercalation of sodium ions into the black phosphorus anode, which is associated with cyclability / reusability.</p>



<p>In the end, I determined that sodium-BP battery chemistry had a relatively low degree of cyclability / reusability (specifically, the sodium ions were too large and ripped apart the layered anode as they entered and exited it, which led to a much lower anode charge capacity over just a few charge-discharge cycles). If they can ever be made commercially feasible, sodium ion batteries will be very interesting because they stand a chance at replacing lithium in some applications (those where energy density and current capacity are not concerns, like renewable energy storage). Lithium is rare, a conflict mineral, and quickly running out / becoming more expensive to extract, while sodium is extremely plentiful everywhere you look, especially the ocean. I&#8217;m very happy to have played a tiny part in moving the world in a more renewable direction.</p>

<p>Coin cell battery that I assembled, ruptured due to bad assembly. For the first few weeks I worked on this project, around half the batteries ruptured like this partway through testing until I figured out the mistake I was making in the assembly process and fixed it.</p>

<p>From January &#8211; June 2022, I captained my rocket team of ~30 people. My time as captain culminated in our competing in Spaceport America Cup 2022 in New Mexico, where we finished in the top third of teams.</p>



<p>Pictured above is our other launch of the season, a test launch in Illinois about a month before the competition. I&#8217;m in the center.</p>



<p>As captain, I managed the team&#8217;s schedule and delegated tasks to team leads to ensure readiness for the test flight and competition. I acted as a systems engineer to ensure proper integration and cooperation between teams. I communicated with competition officials before and during the competition to submit various deliverables on time and keep the rest of the team informed. I also assembled our commercial rocket motors (CTI N5600) for both our test and competition launches. This season was especially difficult because most of our team, even some of the team leads, did not have any hands-on experience as a result of COVID and an associated dip in team activity and membership.</p>

<p>This role taught me a lot about conflict resolution and communication. The team had frequent internal conflicts (as college teams are wont to do), and I personally intervened in/mediated a few, especially those where safety was involved. I held design reviews, both for individual subteams and for the entire competition rocket. I reached out to academic, corporate, and individual donors and managed to raise more than $50k total for the team. </p>

<p>Our competition was disastrous, partly due to lacking team readiness and partly due to circumstances (the rental car I was driving broke down, another hit a deer; our trailer&#8217;s tires had to be replaced halfway to competition; extremely unlikely series of storms; all manner of rocket malfunctions). Through all of this, I did my best to keep the team strong and optimistic, and we ended up having a picture-perfect launch. Our recovery didn&#8217;t go as well and we had to leave part of our rocket in the desert. This part was later found and shipped back to us, thanks to calculations I did regarding the location of our missing rocket section which let hiker volunteers find it.</p>

<p>After the competition, and two of the most stressful weeks of my life, I implemented changes for the following season to hopefully eliminate all of the problems we encountered, including creating a designated systems engineer role to increase communication between subteams. </p>

<p>This experience taught me how to lead a large team effectively, even under a state of extreme and prolonged stress for everyone involved. While it was a huge challenge, I rose to it and wouldn&#8217;t give up the experience for anything. I am a massively better leader because of the all the adversity that we faced and beat as a team.</p>

<p>Top: P&amp;ID for our planned kerolox, 1000lbf, 700psi Pc, N2 pressed engine. <a href="https://patrickwspencer7973e68df9.files.wordpress.com/2023/02/image-73.png">Link to full-sized image</a><br>Middle 1: Control panel built in LabVIEW for the same feed system. <br>Middle 2: Combustion chamber for previously (no longer) planned 1000lbf ethanol/nitrous engine.<br>Bottom: Most of the team&#8217;s hardware, which was initially built for above engine.</p>



<p>I have been the lead of my rocket team&#8217;s propulsion subteam since September 2020. My subteam usually had between 5 and 10 members. I inherited an ethanol/nitrous engine. We decided to switch to kerosene/LOX in early 2022 because of more member and advisor experience with LOX than nitrous, kerolox being more industry-applicable, and still being able to use most of our existing hardware after switching.</p>



<p>As propulsion lead, I taught all parts of propulsion design to team members, including fluid systems, combustion, cooling, component selection, P&amp;ID design, and various aspects of safety. I communicated frequently with our team&#8217;s liquid propulsion advisor and various university contacts including safety professionals and university leadership (for funding). I oversaw the creation of an entirely new feed system P&amp;ID (pictured above), lead the team through a propellant switch, and largely decided the direction of the team.</p>



<p>We have yet to hot-fire anything, but we have less of a &#8220;paper engine&#8221; than many propulsion teams. We have a mostly completed test stand (red weldment pictured above) and already have most of the components in the above P&amp;ID in hand. However, we&#8217;ve also been beset by funding and bureaucratic issues, as well as the obvious COVID, otherwise we would have been able to hot-fire years ago (our liquids team was started around 2018, a year before I joined the team). To get past these issues, we decided in January 2023 to focus on a ~10lb thrust engine to be used in the future as an igniter for our main engine, to raise funds, build member experience, and showcase safe rocket engine operation. We are also working on a custom engine simulation program capable of simulating regen cooling, and with an iterative solver to determine optimal design conditions (wall thicknesses, cooling channel geometry, size, and number) for a given variable (like coolant temperature at exit from cooling channel).</p>



<p>Almost all of the skills I possess, technical and communicative, were first developed on the propulsion team. Through my time as a member and lead, I&#8217;ve learned a truly indescribable amount about liquid rocket engines and everything surrounding them (DAQ/control systems, fluid systems, test stands, safety), and just as much about the arts of leadership, effective task delegation, member mentorship, and good ol&#8217; clear, concise communication.</p>

<p>This is a vehicle that 2 friends and I have been working on since August 2022. It is a VTVL rocket propelled by pressurized CO2, weighs about 30lb empty and 60lb full of propellant, and is about 4 feet tall, with the central yellow tank being about 2.5 feet long. It is designed to be able to hover for up to 30 seconds. </p>



<p>The vehicle&#8217;s central yellow tank (composite with aluminum liner) was donated to our rocket team by an aviation refurbishing company, and in a previous life held nitrogen in a 757.</p>
</div>
</div>



<p>This means it is extremely lightweight and rated to hold very high pressures, which makes it perfect for a vehicle that is a flying tank with some valves and legs strapped on. The presence of this tank enabled this project, and 20+ seconds of flight on a propellant as inefficient as cold gas would not be possible otherwise.</p>



<p>While we&#8217;re all fairly experienced, a project this complex does not (and should not) get built right away after an initial design is completed. Instead, we have been working on validating different aspects of this vehicle separately, well before the vehicle build actually begins.</p>



<p>My contribution to the project has been: high-level design decisions, the CAD of the vehicle pictured above, <a href="https://pwspencer.com/2023/02/28/closed-loop-control-self-stabilizing-stick/">a self-stabilizing stick</a> to learn more about closed loop control basics, and a drone design intended to imitate the control characteristics (specifically, thrust to weight and angular acceleration caused by attitude thrusters) of the eventual vehicle. Drone CAD and assembled frame (electronics and code currently WIP) pictured below.</p>

<p><strong>Attitude control</strong></p>



<p>This has been the largest area of work thus far.  We started out the project by investigating different attitude thruster configurations (pitch/yaw thrusters in above image), and generated graphs of efficiency and relative thrust by angle of thrust (using two or more thrusters to pitch the vehicle in a certain direction).</p>

<p>After settling on an architecture (four valves/thrusters on top of the vehicle, and two on the side for roll control), we began writing a simulation program in MATLAB, which was able to inform us about required engine throttling ability (we initially wanted to pulse the main thruster for simplicity, but determined this was not feasible for landing the vehicle safely) and attitude thruster strength (needed much less thrust than expected). Simulation program pictured below.</p>

<p>My own stick and drone projects have also been a significant part of our investigation into attitude control.</p>



<p><strong>Valve design</strong></p>



<p>We decided to go with custom solenoid valves for our attitude thrusters due to the high weight and cost of commercial options, and a custom stepper motor-actuated spool valve for the main thruster mainly for cost reasons. The main valve design is complete and we hope to begin machining and testing soon.</p>

<p><strong>Leg design</strong></p>



<p>We designed and tested a subscale assembly of the planned leg design, CAD of which is pictured below.</p>

<p>Our qualitative testing led to added tensioning wires on the main vehicle design, hoping to keep the legs stable and the feet facing the ground while also being able to absorb the impact of landing.</p>



<p>We have also put initial design work into eddy current dampers to be able to tolerate less-than-perfect landings and be easily reusable (as compared to using a crushing damper).</p>

<p>This project is a subset of the Hopper project, <a href="https://pwspencer.com/2023/02/28/hopper/">more on that here</a>. I built this in September 2022. The purpose of this project was to get more experience with control systems.</p>



<p>I designed, built, programmed, and tuned all parts of this stick. It consists of a carbon fiber rod held in a joint, free to swivel. Attached to the rod is an IMU (BNO055) and compressed air nozzles (using shop compressed air) controlled by solenoid valves (manifold visible in picture below). A Raspberry Pi talks to the IMU and the solenoid valves (by way of a relay board) and runs control code.</p>

<div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow">
<p>The &#8220;nozzles&#8221; are just cap fittings with a hole drilled in them. They are secured to the stick by 3D printed brackets which are bolted to a laser-cut wood circle, which is then attached to the rod with another 3D printed bracket. The rod is clamped at the joint, instead of bolted, to allow for easy adjustment. The joint has four bearings, which lets the rod swivel smoothly on two axes. The joint is attached to 80/20 extrusion, which extends to a table where it is weighted down to keep everything upright. The rod also features attachment points to add mass, which is important to change the rod&#8217;s moment of inertia and thus its control characteristics. Changing MoI is the purpose of the large metal objects above and below the joint.</p>
</div>
</div>



<p>The solenoid valves are meant for use in irrigation (I chose them because of their very low cost), which somewhat limited the final control abilities of the stick: the minimum time the valves would stay open for was around a quarter second, and within that constraint the stabilization displayed in the video above is about as good as it got working, unless we ever swap in new valves (they are the bottleneck control-wise of the system). </p>



<p>The part of this project where I learned the most was the control code. I&#8217;d never done custom closed-loop control before, and in this project I programmed a PD loop (proportional + derivative) from the ground up in Python, without using any control libraries. If I redid this project, I would instead choose C because it is much more common for this type of application and it runs much faster. Python&#8217;s speed wasn&#8217;t a limitation in this case because the valves were so slow, but it&#8217;s just not really meant for this kind of application. </p>



<p>The IMU worked for this application, but not perfectly. The BNO055 is 9DOF (accel + gyro + mag), but I mainly just used the accelerometers. It did have some issues with forgetting settings and resetting sensor calibration, which I solved by just feeding it all of that information every few seconds. It also had a strange intermittent issue where two of it axes flipped with no discernible cause, obviously destroying the ability of the system to control itself. If I were to redo this project, I would probably choose a simpler IMU- some of the sensor fusion modes caused issues, and I didn&#8217;t really need the 9DOF capability.</p>



<p>All of my prints pretty much worked on the first try. I did have to reprint the part of the joint that interfaces with the aluminum extrusion because it was too small. The nozzles also worked well enough. It was possible to turn the compressed air wall valve and meter how much air came out, which helped with finding the sweet spot for good control. The tubing I initially chose was too flexible and would balloon a concerning amount with compressed air inside (the 100psi of the wall was way more than it was rated for), so I swapped it for more rigid, thicker-walled tubing which worked well but yanked on the rod more, which made control a bit tougher.</p>



<p>This stick imitated the control setup of our planned vehicle, pictured below, with cold gas (CO2) nozzles on top of the vehicle for attitude control.</p>

<p>Between Sept 2021 and Apr 2022, I was on the propulsion team (~5 people) for XL-1, Masten Space Systems&#8217;  NASA-contracted (through CLPS) lunar lander. I was in charge of routing and positioning most propulsion components inside the lander, including valves (various types), regulators, fittings, tubes, clamps, brackets, etc. I did this using Solidworks, and by coordinating with the structures, integration, and systems teams on topics like structural interfaces between propulsion and the vehicle, integration order and schedule, mass budgets, and everything else required to position the vehicle&#8217;s propulsion system in a way that would interfere the least with other systems, make vehicle integration the easiest, and be strong enough to survive the trip to the moon.</p>



<p>I learned a massive amount about fluid system design through being on the XL-1 team, including tube bend considerations, support/structural requirements, insulation, material compatibility, how to make assembly/fabrication easy both for single tube runs and entire assemblies, pressure drop considerations/line balancing, plumbing and instrumentation diagram design, and the art of making easily-modifiable CAD, both parts and assemblies.</p>



<p>This role taught me a massive amount about in-space propulsion, vehicle design, mission design, and of course fluid system design. However, the skill that I improved through this role that I have most appreciated is much less technical: communication. I constantly communicated with a wide variety of people, and disagreements were not uncommon. Because of this, I really learned the value of concise, clear, respectful communication, and how to employ it to get results. This skillset has been invaluable since my time at Masten, during which I captained my school&#8217;s 30-student rocket team through competing in the Spaceport America Cup to a finish in the top third of teams. </p>



<p>At Masten, I was also part of <a href="https://pwspencer.com/2023/02/28/xodiac-testing/">VTVL rocket testing</a>.</p>

<p>This is the rocket that got me my Level 1 certification in May 2021. It is about 2&#8243; diameter, about 8&#8242; long, and around 5lbs. I call it Scrapheap because it was mostly built out of parts I found laying around unused in my rocket team&#8217;s workshop. Most of its length is empty tube, I just wanted to make a really long rocket.</p>



<p>I designed it in OpenRocket (design/simulation software), cut the fiberglass body tubes to size, epoxied on the plywood fins, machined a metal coupler, laser cut various internal plywood parts, set up the recovery system with proper parachutes and shock cord, and programmed the settings for the onboard electronics.</p>



<p>This was my first foray into rocketry. It had two altimeters and two parachutes. Looking back now, the name &#8220;Scrapheap&#8221; is even more applicable because of how awful the build quality was, but I didn&#8217;t know that at the time..</p>



<p>It flew once, to about 900&#8242;, and had a perfect flight in spite of a very rushed launch day. Launch video below.</p>

<p>This is the rocket that got me my Tripoli Level 2 certification in June 2021. I call it Prismatic. It is 4&#8243; diameter, ~40&#8243; long, and weighed about 7lbs ready for flight. It flew dual deploy (two parachutes) with three altimeters. The scarfed tube fin design is definitely unique-looking, which was my goal (it certainly isn&#8217;t optimal aerodynamically!). </p>



<p>To build it, I designed the rocket in OpenRocket (rocket design/flight simulation software), designed the nosecone and internal avionics bay in Solidworks, 3D printed them, cut tubes to size, laser cut various internal wood components, set up the recovery system (parachutes), and programmed the onboard electronics. The specific method of fin attachment present here is somewhat unique even among other tube-fin rocket designs.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, I don&#8217;t have video of its 2 flights, but they both went to around 3500&#8242; and both went perfectly. The first was on a J99 motor (average 99 newtons of thrust), which is special because it has a 10 second long burn, which it accomplishes by being an endburner. The second was a J200something and was fun but unremarkable. </p>



<p>Longburning motors are very cool. The J99 burn wasn&#8217;t finished even by the time the rocket was no longer visible. The flight went great, and even though it heavily weathercocked into the wind, the wind brought it almost right back to the launch pad.</p>



<p>On the other hand, the day was a bit of a trainwreck. I launched with only a few minutes left in the waiver, after taking the L2 test, because I showed up unprepared and took many hours to get to a launch-ready state. After I did the same thing for my L1 a month earlier. There&#8217;s nothing like experiencing two <em>extremely</em> hectic and stressful launch days to drill in the importance of checklists and prep.</p>

<p>I built this drone from parts in August 2021. I selected components that would work together (flight computer, electronic speed controller (motor controller), video transmitter, camera, battery, motors, frame, radio receiver), soldered (20-30 joints) them together with the help of a wiring diagram I made, troubleshooted various electrical gremlins, and eventually got it flying great. Its propellers are 5&#8243; diameter and it weighed about 700g with a battery.</p>



<p>The frame came mostly ready to be built, so there wasn&#8217;t much mechanical to this project besides tightening a few bolts, although I did print the gopro holder out of TPU (which worked surprisingly well for not having printed TPU before, and for having a Bowden tube instead of direct drive). </p>



<p>The flight computer came with the firmware I wanted (Betaflight). I flashed new firmware to the radio receiver, going for the open-source expressLRS instead of the stock FrSky protocol. This worked very well. Since then, eLRS has become way more common, and now there is no reason to flash eLRS onto anything, because preflashed eLRS hardware is available at impressively cheap prices.</p>



<p>The fully finished drone worked perfectly. I don&#8217;t know exactly what speeds it could get up to, but it wouldn&#8217;t surprise me if it could reach 80mph and I know I pulled at least 10 gs of acceleration at one point. Flight time was about 6 minutes depending on the battery and gopro presence.</p>

<p>Flight computer, wiring</p>



<p>This drone lived a pretty tough life. I built it (mainly by frame choice) to be very strong and durable, so it got smashed into walls (even concrete a few times..) and the ground a lot and didn&#8217;t complain much. Eventually, in March 2022, I flew too close to the sun showing off my flying skills to some friends and it ended up 100ft up a tree. See if you can find it.</p>

<p>And as far as I know, that is where it remains, if it hasn&#8217;t been knocked out of the tree yet (I&#8217;ve gone back to check on it a few times, but it&#8217;s very firmly lodged). I tried a few different things to get it out, but I was becoming a bit less interested in RC at the time anyways, getting busier and my FPV goggles had broken and I didn&#8217;t want to spend on new ones. My plan for getting things out of trees in the future is arborist throw weights. Or a bow and arrow.</p>

<p>I wish I could get a recording of an especially fast run, but my bot doesn&#8217;t seem to play very nice with video recording software. It did get a 25 second run in the video above. Also, to get the 9 second run, it was on very fast, but thus risky and restart-prone settings. Watching fails over and over isn&#8217;t fun (for me either, which is why I had the bot save screengrabs of wins for me). </p>



<p>This bot is about 500 lines of Python. This is the core loop it runs through:<br>1. Takes screenshot of board area<br>2. Parses screenshot to update game board information (where a tile is 1, 2, unexplored, blank, etc) by looking at one pixel on each tile. The color of that pixel determines the state. This is possible because each number is a different color in Minesweeper (and also a different color from blank or unexplored tiles).<br>3. Updates bomb locations with very simple algorithm.<br>4. Identifies clickable tiles with very simple algorithm and clicks on them.</p>



<p>It also has capabilities to automatically restart the game, detect wins and print out a screengrab of them, and logic to pick a tile least likely to be a bomb when there are no obvious clear tiles to click on (more on this later).</p>



<p>By far the largest limitation on this bot is its method of board information gathering where it takes a screenshot. If the bot was directly pipelined into Minesweeper (running the game internally, and just displaying the board for humans) solve time would almost definitely be less than a second. </p>



<p>Also, if I were to modify this bot for almost any other version of Minesweeper (I&#8217;ll probably get to this eventually &#8211; only minimal changes required), it would be a lot faster. The animation on Google&#8217;s Minesweeper of the green squares falling away from the board after clicking on a tile means the bot has to wait a long time between clicking and scanning the board for reliable results.</p>



<p>A smarter bot using image recognition wouldn&#8217;t have as bad of a problem with this (although it would certainly still be a problem), but image recognition is slow on the computers I have access to. Instead, my bot grabs a single pixel per game tile, and compares its color to known tile colors to find what tile it is. This is pretty reliable (when the pixel it looks at isn&#8217;t obscured by a falling green square), but it is very sensitive to the pixel&#8217;s position inside the tile. Before doing anything, the bot first gets the pixel heights and widths of each row and column, respectively. This lets it target the same position inside each tile. Also, this technique is only possible at all because there happens to be very small areas where, in the font the game uses, all of the numbers overlap. If this weren&#8217;t the case, the bot would have to scan two or more pixels, which would be easy to implement, but (likely significantly) slower.</p>



<p>The way the bot&#8217;s bomb logic works is this: For every numbered tile on the board, if it only has as many unexplored tiles around it as its number, then those unexplored tiles are bombs.</p>



<p>The clicking logic works similarly: For every numbered tile on the board, if it has as many bombs around it as its number, then click on all of the unexplored tiles around it.</p>



<p>Somewhat surprisingly, these two rules are pretty much all that&#8217;s needed to solve Minesweeper. The only edge case is when there are no obvious tiles to click on:</p>

<p>There are multiple possible bomb arrangements for situations like this, which makes it a much more difficult problem than other orientations. In situations like these, I&#8217;m not sure if there are tiles that are always bombs or always safe. It would seem like either a bomb or a safe tile could be placed at any one of the unexplored perimeter tiles and a solution could be found for bomb positions, but I haven&#8217;t ran through that for this or any other orientation. It&#8217;s also possible that in this orientation there are no &#8220;always bomb&#8221; or &#8220;always safe&#8221; tiles, but in other orientations there are.</p>



<p>Anyways, creating a solver for situations like the above seemed probably impossible, and a lot of work for not much gain if it&#8217;s not (many runs that end up winning never have to click on any &#8216;indeterminate&#8217; tiles). My solution was to click based on probability of being a bomb. At first, I looked at every numbered tile, found the one with the most unexplored tiles around it, and clicked on one of them randomly. However, this lead to things like clicking to a tile right next to a &#8216;6&#8217; tile, because on the other side it had a &#8216;1&#8217; with a lot of unexplored tiles around it. I realized it&#8217;s smarter to instead look at unexplored tiles, and find the one with the lowest (nonzero, where unexplored or blank tiles are zero) sum of numbers around it. This still isn&#8217;t the best, because it doesn&#8217;t take into account at all the information gained from a click, but something like that is a lot harder to quantify. It works decent enough, and never clicks on tiles that have big numbers around them, which is all I need it to do. Ran at slower speeds (so the board scanning process is 100% successful), this logic clicking a bomb tile is pretty much the only time the bot ever fails &#8211; the bomb and clicking logic stated above are perfect. It&#8217;s interesting that a game can be condensed down to two very simple rules for 95% of cases.</p>



<p>The bot is not very widely applicable. It works in my browser, on my screen resolution, with the google minesweeper link pulled up, and sometimes not even then. The way the bot is written, it actually wouldn&#8217;t be too much of a hassle to get it working on other platforms, I just don&#8217;t want to go through the work of making a &#8220;final product&#8221; that has few enough bugs to be worthy of being ran on other computers (far from the current state &#8211; it&#8217;s not that hard to get going or to have it get wins, but it makes). No board size or location is assumed, you just need to feed the bot a screen snip of the board and the few layers of pixels around it. It doesn&#8217;t just have a hardcoded screen location, which would be the easiest way to approach the problem of knowing where the board is.</p>



<p>There were a lot of roadblocks in this project. I didn&#8217;t (and don&#8217;t!) know much about programming, so I learned a lot working through them. One of the most annoying things I learned was that the most available or common libraries are by no means the best. I used the library &#8220;pyautogui&#8221; for image recognition, pixel comparisons, and clicking on the screen for the start of this project. Over time I learned that the way it does all of those things is slow, bad, or even slow and bad. For image recognition, it&#8217;s just slow. This is the only thing I&#8217;m still using the library for, because I couldn&#8217;t find a simple alternative that&#8217;s any faster. For pixel comparisons (grabbing a pixel on the board and checking it against a known RGB value) the library has an extremely annoying bug where the pixel comparison function inexplicably stops working after a few thousand uses, and doesn&#8217;t start working again until the computer is restarted. Apparently it&#8217;s something to do with the library not playing nice with the Windows function it uses to acquire RGB values of the screen. To replace this, I used Pillow (PIL) to get the pixel from the screen and wrote a few lines of code to do the comparison (which also ended up being a lot faster than the original library&#8217;s version, even though it&#8217;s doing everything the original version did). For clicking on things, pyautogui is <em>very</em> slow compared to other clicker libraries (I went with &#8220;mouse&#8221;)- on the order of 100x slower, and also seemed to sometimes click in places other than specified. </p>



<p>There&#8217;s also things I can&#8217;t blame on libraries: Originally, for comparing pixels, I was using a function that took a screenshot of the board for every pixel compared. This is a) completely pointless and b) very slow, and it took me a while to catch it. </p>



<p>After these rewrites, the bot became much (~5x) faster, and then the bottleneck turned into aspects of the game (aforementioned animation) instead of aspects of the code, so for the version played, it really cannot get much faster. </p>



<p>If I were to redo this project, there&#8217;s a lot I would do differently. In the current version, the game board is one 2-dimensional array, the same size as the number of rows and columns in the game itself. Things like specifying bombs and where to click are done on this board only, which means it has a lot of things being done to it. In a future version, I would make this array three-dimensional, and have &#8216;layers&#8217; for each type of tile that is not something scanned in from the board: identified bombs, tiles to be clicked on, tile least likely to be a bomb if there are no definite safe tiles, etc. I&#8217;m not sure the performance (speed) impacts this might have, but it would certainly simplify code and give the ability to do some things that would currently be a pain to implement. For example, the program currently does not save where it has clicked on, and as it iterates through the board looking for safe tiles to click on, it double-clicks on a lot of tiles (because the board is only scanned once every game loop). This doesn&#8217;t really matter because of how fast the clicking happens, but it would be nice to have it only click once. To do this, the clicked on tile must be saved in some way. I tried to do this by saving it as a state on the board, but this caused errors for a lot of the bomb-scanning and clicking logic that were expecting a different value for an unexplored tile. I fixed this, but eventually removed it entirely because it was clunky and making things more difficult. There are other elegant ways to solve this, but one is an entirely separate array for the points that have been clicked on in a given game loop.</p>



<p>This project gave me the ability to have code look at something on the screen visually, parse for the desired information, and interact with it by clicking or typing. I can see that being very useful in some situations. Also, the situations that these skills would help with would be some of the most annoying situations, where a human is required to perform the same very simple task over and over again. So if I ever have to enter thousands of data points into a program manually, or go through many files and perform an action on them based on their name, I know who to call [my code from this project, and pray that it has enough comments to be intelligible].</p>
