<p>Top: Coin cell batteries going through electrical testing on galvanostat<br>Bottom: Black phosphorus anodes ready for battery assembly</p>



<p>Between Feb &#8211; May 2021, during my internship at my university&#8217;s renewable energy lab, I managed a research project investigating performance of sodium and black phosphorus as battery electrode materials. I was in charge of all steps of the process, from material and component preparation (like the electrodes above), to battery assembly, to electrical testing to determine voltage, capacity, and cyclability properties among others, to examining battery electrodes with Raman and X-ray diffraction spectroscopy, and then using that spectroscopy data to make changes to material prep and battery assembly in order to improve electrical properties. </p>



<p>I presented my progress weekly to one of the lab&#8217;s professors and communicated constantly with other researchers for advice and assistance. I also frequently read literature published on similar battery chemistries to find new ways to improve electrical performance.</p>



<p>I prepared the battery anodes by mixing black phosphorus with additives in specific ratios, then pressed the resultant layered material onto a wire mesh substrate (pictured above). These phosphorus anodes were dried for a day, and then moved into an argon glovebox, along with the other battery components for battery assembly. In the glovebox, I made the sodium metal cathode and assembled the batteries, then removed them from the glovebox and hooked them up for electrical testing, which could take a few days. After they were depleted to a certain voltage or had been cycled between two voltages a certain number of times, I identified specific cells which had the potential to produce interesting spectroscopy results and then prepared them for examination and used Raman or XrD spectroscopy machines and associated software to examine material properties &#8211; specifically, the degree of intercalation of sodium ions into the black phosphorus anode, which is associated with cyclability / reusability.</p>



<p>In the end, I determined that sodium-BP battery chemistry had a relatively low degree of cyclability / reusability (specifically, the sodium ions were too large and ripped apart the layered anode as they entered and exited it, which led to a much lower anode charge capacity over just a few charge-discharge cycles). If they can ever be made commercially feasible, sodium ion batteries will be very interesting because they stand a chance at replacing lithium in some applications (those where energy density and current capacity are not concerns, like renewable energy storage). Lithium is rare, a conflict mineral, and quickly running out / becoming more expensive to extract, while sodium is extremely plentiful everywhere you look, especially the ocean. I&#8217;m very happy to have played a tiny part in moving the world in a more renewable direction.</p>

<p>Coin cell battery that I assembled, ruptured due to bad assembly. For the first few weeks I worked on this project, around half the batteries ruptured like this partway through testing until I figured out the mistake I was making in the assembly process and fixed it.</p>

<p>From January &#8211; June 2022, I captained my rocket team of ~30 people. My time as captain culminated in our competing in Spaceport America Cup 2022 in New Mexico, where we finished in the top third of teams.</p>



<p>Pictured above is our other launch of the season, a test launch in Illinois about a month before the competition. I&#8217;m in the center.</p>



<p>As captain, I managed the team&#8217;s schedule and delegated tasks to team leads to ensure readiness for the test flight and competition. I acted as a systems engineer to ensure proper integration and cooperation between teams. I communicated with competition officials before and during the competition to submit various deliverables on time and keep the rest of the team informed. I also assembled our commercial rocket motors (CTI N5600) for both our test and competition launches. This season was especially difficult because most of our team, even some of the team leads, did not have any hands-on experience as a result of COVID and an associated dip in team activity and membership.</p>

<p>This role taught me a lot about conflict resolution and communication. The team had frequent internal conflicts (as college teams are wont to do), and I personally intervened in/mediated a few, especially those where safety was involved. I held design reviews, both for individual subteams and for the entire competition rocket. I reached out to academic, corporate, and individual donors and managed to raise more than $50k total for the team. </p>

<p>Our competition was disastrous, partly due to lacking team readiness and partly due to circumstances (the rental car I was driving broke down, another hit a deer; our trailer&#8217;s tires had to be replaced halfway to competition; extremely unlikely series of storms; all manner of rocket malfunctions). Through all of this, I did my best to keep the team strong and optimistic, and we ended up having a picture-perfect launch. Our recovery didn&#8217;t go as well and we had to leave part of our rocket in the desert. This part was later found and shipped back to us, thanks to calculations I did regarding the location of our missing rocket section which let hiker volunteers find it.</p>

<p>After the competition, and two of the most stressful weeks of my life, I implemented changes for the following season to hopefully eliminate all of the problems we encountered, including creating a designated systems engineer role to increase communication between subteams. </p>

<p>This experience taught me how to lead a large team effectively, even under a state of extreme and prolonged stress for everyone involved. While it was a huge challenge, I rose to it and wouldn&#8217;t give up the experience for anything. I am a massively better leader because of the all the adversity that we faced and beat as a team.</p>

<p>Top: P&amp;ID for our planned kerolox, 1000lbf, 700psi Pc, N2 pressed engine. <a href="https://patrickwspencer7973e68df9.files.wordpress.com/2023/02/image-73.png">Link to full-sized image</a><br>Middle 1: Control panel built in LabVIEW for the same feed system. <br>Middle 2: Combustion chamber for previously (no longer) planned 1000lbf ethanol/nitrous engine.<br>Bottom: Most of the team&#8217;s hardware, which was initially built for above engine.</p>



<p>I have been the lead of my rocket team&#8217;s propulsion subteam since September 2020. My subteam usually had between 5 and 10 members. I inherited an ethanol/nitrous engine. We decided to switch to kerosene/LOX in early 2022 because of more member and advisor experience with LOX than nitrous, kerolox being more industry-applicable, and still being able to use most of our existing hardware after switching.</p>



<p>As propulsion lead, I taught all parts of propulsion design to team members, including fluid systems, combustion, cooling, component selection, P&amp;ID design, and various aspects of safety. I communicated frequently with our team&#8217;s liquid propulsion advisor and various university contacts including safety professionals and university leadership (for funding). I oversaw the creation of an entirely new feed system P&amp;ID (pictured above), lead the team through a propellant switch, and largely decided the direction of the team.</p>



<p>We have yet to hot-fire anything, but we have less of a &#8220;paper engine&#8221; than many propulsion teams. We have a mostly completed test stand (red weldment pictured above) and already have most of the components in the above P&amp;ID in hand. However, we&#8217;ve also been beset by funding and bureaucratic issues, as well as the obvious COVID, otherwise we would have been able to hot-fire years ago (our liquids team was started around 2018, a year before I joined the team). To get past these issues, we decided in January 2023 to focus on a ~10lb thrust engine to be used in the future as an igniter for our main engine, to raise funds, build member experience, and showcase safe rocket engine operation. We are also working on a custom engine simulation program capable of simulating regen cooling, and with an iterative solver to determine optimal design conditions (wall thicknesses, cooling channel geometry, size, and number) for a given variable (like coolant temperature at exit from cooling channel).</p>



<p>Almost all of the skills I possess, technical and communicative, were first developed on the propulsion team. Through my time as a member and lead, I&#8217;ve learned a truly indescribable amount about liquid rocket engines and everything surrounding them (DAQ/control systems, fluid systems, test stands, safety), and just as much about the arts of leadership, effective task delegation, member mentorship, and good ol&#8217; clear, concise communication.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m on the left in orange.</p>



<p>Between Sept &#8211; Nov 2021, I was a member of the testing team for Xodiac, Masten (now Astrobotic)&#8217;s testbed VTVL rocket. </p>



<p>I was on the test team for 6 total flights: 4 tethered to a forklift and 2 free. I performed various checkouts: valve operation (pictured above), torque stripes, leak, and electrical. I also armed the flight termination system and assisted with propellant and pressurant fill (including cryogenic), vehicle transportation, and test equipment preparation. Xodiac has 100+ completed launches and landings.</p>



<p>Xodiac&#8217;s test team was small, ranging between 5 and 10 people, so I was an important part of the team and relied on, as I relied on my coworkers. </p>



<p>This experience (and helping with various small-engine static fire tests) taught me a massive amount about test engineering and operating under tense, time-sensitive conditions, where a mistake could have cascading consequences. Thankfully, every test I was part of was a full success, but there were a lot of problems the team had to solve to get them all to that point.</p>



<p>For the flights I was involved in, Xodiac&#8217;s payload was ExoCam, which is a camera in a impact-resistant frame that can be ejected from landers close to the surface of a celestial body and record video of the landing. Its testing on Xodiac was aimed at demonstrating capability and working out kinks to prepare for eventually operating on the moon.</p>



<p>At Masten, I was also on the <a href="https://pwspencer.com/2023/02/28/xl-1/">propulsion team for the XL-1 lunar lander</a>.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a tiny cylinder of glass, 2mm diameter by 12mm, with some electronic chips inside: <a href="https://dangerousthings.com/product/next/" rel="nofollow">https://dangerousthings.com/product/next/</a><br><br>I got it implanted a year ago to the day, so it&#8217;s my cyborgiversary! I don&#8217;t actually think I&#8217;m a cyborg, it&#8217;s just fun to say, and has a nice shock factor to it. I think most people would probably consider me a cyborg though, so maybe I actually am by majority rule. </p>



<p>But there&#8217;s really not much different from my implant than tattoos, piercings, or medical implants. The first two have been around for thousands of years, and none of the three are particularly strange now, even across class and gender divisions (there are always hold-outs for the &#8220;traditional ways&#8221;, but times have already changed for the most part, at least in the US). Tattoos and piercings are <em>mostly</em> aesthetic and cultural, without function &#8211; that culture being at any and all levels from personal to global. Medical implants are functional-only in the vast majority of cases, entirely divorced from culture. </p>



<p>Chip implants are in an interesting middle ground &#8211; functional <em>and</em> cultural. I don&#8217;t think there are very many people who get a chip implant and don&#8217;t interact at all with the &#8220;biohacker&#8221; culture surrounding them, and also very few people who get a chip implant only because of cultural or personal expression reasons and don&#8217;t use it at all. </p>



<p>As for actual capabilities, they&#8217;re not particularly impressive. I basically just have <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Contactless-Access-13-56MHz-ISO14443-Reader/dp/B0892G81QD">two of these</a> in my hand, one each for RFID and NFC. RFID is mostly used for access control to activate things that you&#8217;d usually carry an access card around for, and NFC mostly to do simple things on smartphones, like pull up a link or pop up a message on screen. There are other types of implants, ranging from financial/payment to LEDs to magnets to temperature sensors, and various more interesting and less proven offerings outside of the &#8220;consumer&#8221; realm (I&#8217;d estimate that Dangerous Things has sells mid triple to low quadruple digit implants yearly, so they&#8217;re not exactly Facebook). </p>



<p>But none of them are magic. The only time the electronics in mine are active is when they&#8217;re millimeters away from an antenna that is scanning them, because they don&#8217;t have any internal battery, instead being powered entirely from transmitted power of the scanning antenna. I can&#8217;t get into anywhere that I didn&#8217;t already have a key card for. I can&#8217;t hack into any locked phones or even cause much of a threat to unlocked ones other than linking them to a virus-infested site. And there&#8217;s definitely no one <a href="https://pwspencer.com/2022/12/24/the-lie-we-tell-ourselves/">tracking or controlling me</a> in any way. The first one is much closer to reality than the second, but a big hurdle that stands firmly in the way of any active implanted electronics is the current lack of biocompatible batteries. Batteries tend to outgas which poses a problem for keeping them in sealed glass capsules, and more broadly stored energy likes to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsuYxFBHsiQ">release</a> <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/samsung-finally-explains-galaxy-note-7-exploding-battery-mess-n710581">itself</a> <a href="https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1502653">sporadically</a> in ways that would not be exactly comfortable or healthy were it happening under your skin. (This is a hurdle that has been cleared in some medical contexts like pacemakers because of an orders-of-magnitude funding difference between medical and non-medical implants.)</p>



<p>For most implantables, there are wearables that can do the same job without sticking anything into yourself. My implant could just as easily be a ring and it would actually work <em>better</em> because of the larger antenna size &#8211; I have to smush my hand against the scanning antenna for any hope of the chips being read, and even then I need to wiggle my hand around a bit to find the right position. </p>



<p>So why get an implant at all?</p>



<p>There are some meager functional benefits. I can misplace a ring, just like I frequently misplace my wallet, but I can&#8217;t misplace my hand! For a semester, I lived in a dorm where I needed an access card to get into my room, and many a time my implant saved me a walk down to the reception desk when I left my wallet in my room. If I&#8217;m ever at any type of conference or convention in the future, I can pop up links to a website or profile with a wave. Maybe most importantly, I can rick roll friends with my hand. </p>



<p>But I also just like it. I enjoy the feeling of autonomy that it reinforces; that my body is mine to do whatever I want with it; that I can take personal responsibility for the risk evaluation that is usually placed on doctors (see the addendum about this at the end of this post). I like that it makes me think about the future. It just plain feels cool.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s interesting to me that many people are taken aback by my implant, many that would probably also be taken aback by the decision <em>not </em>to get a medical implant. The risks are really no more than an ear piercing, and it&#8217;s much less noticeable than one. I can&#8217;t feel it at all. I think the reason it gets a reaction is that it is functional in a non-medical way. It <em>extends</em> functionality instead of <em>replacing</em> it. </p>



<p>But should it?</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t really see my implant as any different than cars, computers, or airplanes, which also clearly extend functionality. But no one thinks twice about these things. Why are extending general functionality and replacing bodily functionality both normal, but extending bodily functionality is not? The body might be sacred to some, but it can&#8217;t be <em>that</em> sacred if you&#8217;ll put a pacemaker or titanium rod in it when push comes to shove.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to modifying my body more in the future, in conventional and unconventional ways. I think it would be a waste of a perfectly good meat suit to not try to spruce it up a bit before it&#8217;s defunct.</p>

<p>Addendum: Broad bodily autonomy</p>



<p>I fully respect those who do not want anything &#8220;unnatural&#8221; in their bodies, even lifesaving medical interventions like pacemakers. Bodily autonomy is important for everyone, not just people who <em>do</em> want to modify their bodies.</p>



<p><br>Addendum: Health impacts</p>



<p>This is something that is most people&#8217;s concern after &#8220;that&#8217;s really weird&#8221; &#8211; it was definitely mine when I heard about it. As far as I know, no non-medical implants are approved or sanctioned by any government agency or medical practitioners, so it is definitely &#8220;at your own risk&#8221;. However, that risk isn&#8217;t really any greater than an ear or face piercing. </p>



<p>Much of the following is about my specific implant type, but most of it applies to implants generally. </p>



<p><a href="https://forum.dangerousthings.com/t/tests-weve-performed-on-our-x-series-tags/474">A large variety of tests</a> have been performed on the implant type encompassing mine. It arrived in a syringe, which was pre-sterilized and sealed inside packaging, only opened very shortly before it is used. It is easily removable from wherever it is implanted/installed in the rare event that it cracks, stops working, or causes medical problems (which is extremely unlikely because the glass housing is completely inert biologically, and not &#8220;seen&#8221; by the immune system. I have not read any accounts of infection or rejection issues from installations by experienced piercers.) </p>



<p>As for breaking and shattering concerns, I haven&#8217;t smashed my hand very hard in the year I&#8217;ve had the implant, but I have read accounts of people who have done everything up to and including literally smashing the implant with a hammer, and haven&#8217;t heard any accounts of the glass housing ever breaking (although the last time I looked was a year ago). There are very limited accounts of electronics ceasing to function, partly from user error and partly not (I don&#8217;t think my specific implant would be simple to brick even if I was trying), but having to remove or replace an implant isn&#8217;t really an item of concern when contrasted with removing hundreds of tiny glass shards from your hand.</p>



<p>Anecdotally, the only pain, discomfort, or even inconvenience that I have been caused is when getting stuck with the needle in the first place. It&#8217;s kind of a dauntingly large needle compared to normal medical needles, but the pain wasn&#8217;t that bad, not even really noticeably worse than getting vaccinated or having blood drawn. I do have a tiny scar from the installation, in the circle to the right of the implant:</p>

<p>It is located just under the skin and resting on the muscles/cartilage, so I can shift it around a decent amount. I can push it about 25% of its length side-to-side, up to about its full length axially depending on the position of my thumb, and tilt it up maybe 30° by pushing down on either end. I feel almost nothing from doing this, other than what anyone feels if they gently press on one hand with the other. There is a slight feeling of pressure against the muscle/cartilage when pressing the implant down into my hand, and an interesting sensation that I assume is the separation and recombination of muscle fibers when moving it side to side while pressing down on it. No matter how I move or press on it, even laying against a hard surface and my other hand pressing with full force, there is no implant-caused pain.</p>



<p>Note that attention to medical concerns will vary drastically depending on the source, which is one of the reasons I bought from one of the largest, if not the largest, non-medical implant companies, and had it installed by a piercer familiar with the brand. There are also more medical concerns with larger implants. </p>



<p>Most implants won&#8217;t have enough metal to really stick out on any sort of security scanner (not that they are illegal anyways), or cause any problems during medical procedures like MRIs. Magnetic implants might be different in both cases, but even then <a href="https://forum.dangerousthings.com/t/fingertip-titan-in-an-mri/16503">anecdotally you&#8217;ll be fine.</a> (Magnetic implants are very interesting, adding a way to pseudo-sense magnetic fields, and I don&#8217;t think it will be long before I have one myself.)</p>



<p>There are risks involved in everything. For chip implants and my personal level of risk tolerance, there doesn&#8217;t seem to be anything worth worrying about.</p>
