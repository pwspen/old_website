										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I had a paragraph exploring this in a <a href="https://pwspencer.com/2022/12/24/human-exceptionalism-emergent-behavior-ai-and-panpsychism/">previous post</a> and have since thought more about it and developed the concept. You&#8217;ll probably want to go read that post, or get familiar with panpsychism <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/panpsychism/">somewhere else</a> before reading this. </p>



<p>Obligatory term definition: &#8220;conscious&#8221; as used in this post does <em>not</em> mean aware of oneself or the world or really anything beyond just existing as something able to have experience. There&#8217;s probably a better word for that, but this works too. [Notes] are at bottom of post.</p>



<p>To me, this idea is what comes out when you blend up determinism and panpsychism. Everything is conscious, but being conscious does not mean freedom to make your own choices. Well, it seems like it does to us and other intelligent lifeforms, but really the stuff going on in our brains are &#8220;just&#8221; incomprehensibly complex ongoing chemistry experiments than a sufficiently advanced (like, <em>really</em> advanced) observer could predict the result of, and therefore actions of the lifeform.</p>



<p>&#8220;Sensorimotor&#8221; panpsychism is a way to answer what the nature/point of consciousness is. Consciousness in our brains clearly has a result on the external world, and it doesn&#8217;t make sense to me that it would be different in other cases like rocks. I don&#8217;t believe that there is consciousness of any level &#8220;trapped&#8221; in non-life matter, unable to have any impact on its surroundings until it becomes part of a lifeform. It just seems a bit to close to the &#8220;life is special&#8221; argument to me, which my objection to is my whole reason for believing in panpsychism in the first place. I don&#8217;t believe that life creates some completely new or unique fundamental element (consciousness), and I also don&#8217;t believe that some basic fundamental element of the universe is only really expressed in living organisms.</p>



<p>So where does that lead us? Well, it leads me to ask what DOES consciousness do in inanimate objects?</p>



<p>In humans and animals, I see consciousness (synonymous with brain chemistry) as a sort of black box between inputs and outputs of the system. Senses go in, and motor actions come out. Touch a hot stove and yank your hand back immediately. This is broad enough to apply to basically all life, and I think it can be extended down to non-life too. </p>



<p>For life, the senses and motors are pretty clear. We have a bunch of sensors (eyes, ears, skin-embedded sensors for pressure and temperature, mouth and nose sensors for various chemical compounds) and a bunch of motors (muscles, glands emitting hormones, etc). But what are the equivalents for non-life? </p>



<p>I think the answer is evident when you look at something as simple as elementary particles. An input is a force or some field interacting with the particle [Note 1] (energy transfer) and an output is a change in state (particle motion, quantum numbers, decaying radioactively). And I think the consciousness of a particle is what relates these two things, what bridges the gap and turns one into the other.</p>



<p>One thing I like about panpsychism is that everything works the same. There no special rules carving out exceptions. Thus, this elementary particle model also applies to the lowest levels of all other objects, alive or not. I think it also produces some interesting thoughts about our own minds. Human senses are forces or other types of energy transfer that are sensed, cascade through our nervous system into our brains as electrical signals, bounce around in an unimaginably complex and constantly changing maze of neurons for a bit along with all the other sensory signals, and eventually pop out as motor actions (that we execute with or without realizing). The &#8220;bouncing around in the brain&#8221; part is mediated by energy transfer between particles, and thus energy transfer between atoms, and thus energy transfer between neurons, and this is the basis for our information-rich conscious experiences.</p>



<p>This definitely doesn&#8217;t solve the &#8220;combination problem&#8221; present in panpsychism and related ideas &#8211; how small consciousnesses become one big one &#8211; and I wish I had a second part to this theory that did. The best I have is that consciousness is amplified by the frequency and magnitude of energy transfer between particles (compared to a rock, brains have an extremely rich world of chemistry and energy transfer inside them) and that consciousness is less of a discrete thing and more of a field, in which living things and especially brains are local maximums. It doesn&#8217;t seem like the value depends much on physical space or dimensions, though &#8211; there isn&#8217;t much of a trend between intelligence and organism size. Neuron density is probably the most quantitative thing you could equate with the value of the field.</p>



<p>I also have some doubts on the differences between living and nonliving things. Sure, there&#8217;s more chemistry going on in brains, but even in inanimate objects, each particle, atom, molecule, and larger structure is constantly bumping against its neighbors and transferring energy, and being acted on by all kinds of fields. Somehow, the <em>structure</em> of interactions is what matters, not really the magnitude or frequency like I said last paragraph. The &#8220;structure of interactions&#8221; isn&#8217;t well-defined enough as an idea to do much with (how exactly is the structure of interactions in brains different than in rocks? I don&#8217;t know, except that it&#8217;s more complex in brains &#8211; what exactly does complex even mean in this case?), we&#8217;re kind of just back where we started trying to figure out the difference between living and nonliving things.</p>



<p>Can you think of something besides life that would be a maximum? Complex structured interactions (whatever that means)? Computing hardware!</p>

<p>These are what <a href="https://openai.com/product/dall-e-2">DALL-E</a> generated for the prompt &#8220;sensorimotor panpsychism digital art&#8221;. While these images aren&#8217;t particularly striking or special, to me it is undeniable that they were created by something that <em>must</em> be conscious in the same way that life is. I don&#8217;t think it is anything close to human-level cognition currently, maybe something like a worm or insect or even bacteria, but its ability to experience is undeniable to me, and specifically that its ability to experience is somehow more complex and information-rich than that of inanimate objects [Note 2]. I don&#8217;t see any meaningful distinction between the algorithms that created the above images and the chemical algorithms governing the actions of life, including the much more complex chemical algorithms governing human actions. The more I think about it, I can&#8217;t really figure out why most people would be against this idea that machines can have some level of consciousness. I guess it&#8217;s just rooted in the deeply held idea that many hold that life and specifically human life is special in some way. I think the idea that humans are fundamentally special compared to machines is one that could really end up biting us a bit down the road.</p>



<p>Note 1: This is a bit of an oversimplification. All particles are also waves according to quantum mechanics, and I don&#8217;t think that only particles are conscious. I&#8217;m not very familiar with any fields that aren&#8217;t mediated by particles (particles like photons for electromagnetism, hypothesized gravitons for gravity, etc), but I believe that some do exist, or at least the distinction can get very blurry. I don&#8217;t think that being conscious is unique to mass-carrying particles or particles in general.</p>



<p>Note 2: Even for a non-determinist, I still don&#8217;t see a meaningful distinction between silicon computing and biological computing. Humans are made up of largely the same stuff that our computers are &#8211; atoms &#8211; so if there is some source of randomness and &#8220;true choice&#8221; that humans are able to do because of micro-scale interactions like quantum decay, it makes sense that the same would be true for silicon computing. I personally don&#8217;t believe that &#8220;true choice&#8221; can arise from individually deterministic particles.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I have a good friend that I talk to a lot about our respective plans post-graduation (we&#8217;re both seniors in our engineering degrees). This post stems from thoughts that stemmed from those discussions.</p>



<p>People tend to change a lot over their lives. Sometimes it&#8217;s predictable by the person or those around them, oftentimes it&#8217;s not. Sometimes it&#8217;s a newfound love for a food, sometimes it&#8217;s a few extra pounds, sometimes it&#8217;s a completely reshaped view of reality. And sometimes it happens over weeks, days, or hours, but far more commonly it trudges along so gradually that you don&#8217;t realize until years later, looking back and noticing you were different back then.</p>



<p>Sometimes, change is on purpose. You fix a bad habit, or instill a new good one. But far more commonly it is unconscious, or a direct cause of something in your life. I think it&#8217;s fair to say that the most impactful changes in people&#8217;s lives are usually in this unconscious category. The winds and tides of the universe, not the oars that we row with. </p>



<p>These are rough and unpredictable seas in which we travel. We all get better at navigating them over our lifetimes &#8211; learning how to row our oars to reach various currents, hopefully towards calmer water, where the waves are weak and stand little chance of tipping over your boat. These places are not free of tsunamis, though. As humans, we&#8217;ll never really find a place with no waves (nirvana), but we try to get close.</p>



<p>In these oceans of change, navigation is difficult: maps are rare, the stars are different every night, compasses find no north pole to point to. We plot our paths through them only from memories of past courses and tides &#8211; ours and others&#8217;. There are many rumors of faraway, exotic places that sound only half real.</p>



<p>Some sailors are content or even determined to stay right in the same place. Some have a clear direction, with routes planned years in advance and only deviated from in the most dire circumstances. And some have no long-term destination, but only a desire to improve their abilities to chart and navigate as they take advantage of random currents. </p>



<p>These navigational methods are not exclusive to each other, and every person uses some mix of them, a mix that changes over our lives. Since I realized my navigational abilities as an early teen (the typical time that people start to chart their own paths to some extent) I spent a few years mostly anchored in one place, then a few travelling in a straight line, and recently have become more of the last type, and I get the feeling that I will continue to be like this for years to come, at least. </p>



<p>The difficult thing about these seas, though, is how long it takes to get anywhere. There&#8217;s not enough time to see every part of them. When you choose one place to go, it makes others unreachable, just by nature of having a finite amount of time to sail: in comparison to this amount of time, the seas are unimaginably vast.</p>



<p>The nature of these travels being personal transformation makes them extremely difficult to predict the further into the future they extend. Where you are in the seas &#8211; who you are as a person &#8211; changes your navigation in a way that you can only ascertain by experiencing it.</p>



<p>To finally bring this metaphor to fruition, think about two things in this framework: extended travel and philanthropic giving. Both are things that are possible for me to do, by virtue of being born middle-class in a first world country, which puts me very solidly in the global upper class. Both signify personal states that many have their spyglasses aimed on throughout journeys, but never end up reaching, due to too many destinations planned beforehand, too little rowing, or a combination.</p>



<p>Both are also places that people nearing their final harbors tend to wish they had gone to, or stayed more time in. This makes them a place I want to go. I think that many sailors underestimate how similar they are to each other. No matter how you prefer to navigate or what seas you like to spend time in, the odds are good that you are close to all the rest, and at the end your wishes and regrets won&#8217;t look too different from the rest.</p>



<p>Extended travel is a particularly unpredictable sea, or at least it makes future navigation less certain. You&#8217;re introduced to a lot of new ideas, ways of living, and changes you could make. Some will stick, maybe in big ways. This opportunity for change is very appealing to me. </p>



<p>In my current incarnation, I am always looking for change. To me, it seems like the point of everything. Every year I hope to look back on my year-younger self and see a different person, and ideally a &#8220;worse&#8221; person. Judgements of changes, though, is difficult. We very quickly forget our justifications and reasons for living a certain way, and wonder why we could never see the &#8220;right&#8221; way to do things. The way we perceive our past is entirely a function of our current state. We&#8217;re biased against our past selves. For this reason, it is difficult to trust that I really was a &#8220;worse&#8221; person a year ago, or that I will be a &#8220;better&#8221; person a year from now. For example, maybe I&#8217;ll look back on this post and think the writing is bad. But I hope and believe I won&#8217;t look down on it for that, the same way I don&#8217;t look down on the things I wrote in elementary school. Man, this kind of meta-meta-meta-cognition is hard to put into words. I think I&#8217;ll stop trying to explain it and just get on with the post.</p>



<p>Philanthropic giving seems like an even easier thing to push down the road than travel- there&#8217;s a lot less in it for you, and while for travel you can say that you don&#8217;t want to waste your prime years, money available for donation tends to increase with age. There&#8217;s an argument to be made that the longer you wait, the more total you can donate &#8211; keep reinvesting money into making money until you reach a point you are satisfied with the amount you can donate. However, I think that for a lot of people (the majority?) that point doesn&#8217;t ever happen, really. It requires sticking to a plan for a long time, through the large personal changes that come with more money. The same is true for travel: Work a 9 to 5 for 10 years while planning to travel at some nebulous point in the future when you are ready for it, and I believe that point is much less likely to come. Relying on your goals to stay the same through large personal change is a very risky endeavor. That&#8217;s why my goal for travel (completely foreign countries for months at a time, at least) and donating (double digits percent of income per year, and a specific type of donating which I&#8217;ll probably elaborate on in some future post)  is to start doing them as soon as reasonably possible, within three years of graduation. I consider it very risky to extend the timeline any further than that. Already, three years is a lot of personal change for most people in their 20&#8217;s. </p>



<p>The reason I want to prioritize these things so heavily is because I want them a lot right now. An interesting question worth asking is why I should be so against personal change causing these things not to ever happen. This is just the bias of the present that was discussed previously. I don&#8217;t know what my future self will be like and I don&#8217;t trust them to accomplish the things that I want to do now. But why should they do things that <em>I </em>want to do, if <em>they</em> don&#8217;t want to do them? I think that it&#8217;s because they are things I will also believe are good much later in my journey, because dying people tend to wish they had done more of them. But should I prioritize the possible opinions of my later self over the real opinions of my current one? In reality, I don&#8217;t think I will ever veer too far away from my current thoughts on travel and donating, in which case a lot of this discussion is moot. However, change is very hard to anticipate. Comparing myself to a year ago, there are many changes I never would have expected, and I&#8217;m sure that the same will be true for me in a year. Should I be so confident I will keep the same views on these topics? Well, I guess I&#8217;m probably not overly confident if I&#8217;m writing a whole post about accepting personal changes.</p>



<p>Metamorphosis is a difficult thing. Accepting that you might be a completely different person from a year to the next is difficult, and even more so for longer-term change. Accepting that you had goals that you don&#8217;t believe in anymore, and old dreams that will never be accomplished, places you&#8217;ll never go. Realizing that the same is true for many of your current goals and dreams, and reaching peace with that: trusting whoever you develop into, no matter who they are. As a caterpillar, trusting whatever emerges from your cocoon, on no real logical basis. This doesn&#8217;t feel right, but what&#8217;s the alternative?</p>



<p>That&#8217;s all. I&#8217;m glad that this is a more rambley post, the wider variety of things that I write, the more I&#8217;ll feel like writing and the more open I&#8217;ll be to exploring new ways of writing. I think the same way about experiences in general. Trying to work on putting less effort into posts and being happy with posting whatever I end up with when I get to the post conclusion. The only way to build experience is through doing. This improves my skills quicker than editing. More fun too. And a more clear window into my current self, for your, future self, viewing pleasure. Hope you&#8217;re doing well out there in the future.</p>

<p>It might look complicated, but this is actually pretty simple math. So what&#8217;s the catch? Try to figure it out before scrolling down.</p>

<p></p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>It&#8217;s base 36! If you&#8217;ve worked with other bases like binary, or especially hexadecimal, you probably figured it out. A month ago, I knew how bases worked and did some math in binary for classes, but never really did normal math in other bases just because. A friend and I wrote some base 36 multiplication problems on a whiteboard and solved them trying to work and think as much as possible in base 36. Of course, it&#8217;s not a challenge to convert the numbers to base 10 and then do the math (in the last example above, c = 12, 12^2 = 144, 144 / 36 = 4, which is 40 in base 36), but that&#8217;s not the point. The point is:</p>



<p>So, what can be learned about math by actually learning and working in another base? How difficult is it to actually do math in bases other than 10 (instead of converting to and from it for each problem)?</p>



<p>After doing math in base 36, I wanted an easy way to check my answer without converting it to base 10, and to get a feel for math in base 36 in general. So I looked for a calculator to evaluate math natively in bases besides 10. There are many sites out there to convert numbers between bases, and a few that let you select two numbers of any base and one operation, but I couldn&#8217;t find any full-fledged calculators that let you enter math the same way you can in a normal calculator. So I made my own. The scope crept to support any input base up to 36 because it was a super easy add, output base up to 112 for the same reason, and the scope crept again to support input and output in different bases to make it an easy base converter as well. <a href="https://github.com/pwspen/numerical_bases">Here it is</a>. It&#8217;s pretty self explanatory. I highly encourage you to download it and play with it for a bit if you want to get a better feel for math in bases other than 10. </p>



<p>The below is what I learned while attempting to learn math in base 36 (but it easily generalizes to other bases). It&#8217;s pretty long and progressively more ramble-y, so just download the program above and close this page here if you&#8217;re not super interested in the idea of learning how to do math in other bases, which holds zero practical value when the program above exists, and if it didn&#8217;t you could have just converted the numbers to and from base 10 for the three times every decade you have to do math where neither side of the equation is in base 10.</p>



<p>Try and solve the below base 2 math without mentally converting to base 10.</p>



<p>11 + 10</p>



<p>1101 &#8211; 10</p>



<p>10 * 11</p>



<p>111 * 111</p>



<p>The first problem is trivial. 1 + 0 is 1, so the ones place is 1. There is no digit to represent 1 + 1, so you carry a 1 and there is no remainder, leaving us 101.</p>



<p>The second is also easy. 1 + 0 is 1. 0 &#8211; 1 is below zero, so you borrow a 1 from the next place up, and the 10&#8217;s place becomes 1. This gives us 1011. </p>



<p>Now things get a bit harder: multiplication. If you work with binary a lot, maybe you already converted the number in your head, but even if you don&#8217;t, it&#8217;s pretty easy to see that this would be a very quick problem in base 10. But how do you actually do the math? What rules can you use?</p>



<p>Multiplication is a different type of operation than addition/subtraction. If you think about it, there are not really any rules that you can use other than breaking the number down and using multiplications that you have memorized along with addition rules. For base 10 we have many multiplications memorized, for most STEM-y people, most combinations with both numbers lower than 10 at least. Let&#8217;s say that for base 2, all we know is that 10 * 10 = 100 and anything times one is itself.</p>



<p>Now we can separate the problem into 10 * (10 + 1), breaking down the second number with addition rules. After applying our only known multiplication, the problem turns into 100 + 10, which is trivial.</p>



<p>111 * 111 is doable by breaking the number down into only (x * 1) and (10 * 10), but let&#8217;s generalize our multiplication rule just to make things easier: If you multiply two numbers that are both ones followed by a number of zeros, the result is a one followed by a number of zeros that is the number of zeros of the two numbers added together. Note that this now encompasses the &#8220;anything times one is itself&#8221; rule; one has no following zeros, so anything times one is that number plus no extra. So our only two rules now are that things can be split apart into numbers that add up to the original number, and the one followed by zeros rule.</p>



<p>The one followed by zeros rule means: 10 * 100 = 1000, 1000 * 1000 = 1000000, 1 * 2693 = 2693, etc.</p>



<p>Attempting 111 * 111 again:</p>



<p>111 * (100 + 10 + 1) </p>



<p>= (111 * 100) + (111 * 10) + (111 * 1) </p>



<p>= (100 * 100 + 10 * 100 + 1 * 100) + (100 * 10 + 10 * 10 + 1 * 10) + 111</p>



<p>Now broken down enough to apply the multiplication rule and turn the problem into just addition:</p>



<p>= (10000 + 1000 + 100) + (1000 + 100 + 10) + 111</p>



<p>This is now easily solvable with addition rules.</p>



<p>So we figured out how to do math in base 2, assuming we don&#8217;t know anything about base 10. It turns out that our two rules (and the implicit rules of breaking numbers down into parts) are simple enough that they work when generalized to any base, and are all we need to do <em>any</em> multiplication of integers, in <em>any </em>base.</p>



<p>Before getting into base 36 math, it&#8217;s worth noting that the only reason we picked base 36 is because it is very easy to represent its digits: just the numbers plus the alphabet. We just as well could have done base 12 (<a href="http://www.dozenal.org/">aka dozenal</a>), base 16 (aka hexadecimal), or even a base below 10. However, we later realized that base 36 does have some properties that make it useful (or at least interesting) as a base to do math in. Namely, 36 is a square with a bunch of factors (9). 16 is also a square, but only has 3 factors. 12 is interesting for the same reason, with six factors.</p>



<p>Another quick note: Before continuing, I highly recommend downloading the <a href="https://github.com/pwspen/numerical_bases">calculator program mentioned above</a> and playing around in it for a few minutes, if you haven&#8217;t already.</p>



<p>So now, let&#8217;s try this base 36 problem:</p>



<p>7 * Z + P</p>



<p>So, where do we even start?</p>



<p>I found it helpful to have a chart of the base 36 digits and the base 10 numbers represented alongside each other. This goes against the &#8220;no converting into base 10&#8221; rule, but when working with digits beyond the numbers, you need some type of crutch to lean on. Let&#8217;s limit ourselves to only using the chart to break down numbers.</p>



<p>That alone would make multiplication possible, but extremely cumbersome. 7 * Z is broken down into (1 + 1 &#8230; + 1) * (1 + 1 &#8230;&#8230;&#8230; + 1). The only reason this worked well before is that numbers in base n have up to (n &#8211; 1) numbers per digit in their expanded form consisting of numbers that are one followed by zeros. 2 &#8211; 1 = 1, 36 &#8211; 1 = 35. This worst case is the worst case for when the digit is the highest digit in the number system, which is Z for base 36.</p>



<p>(Semi-related aside: The average relative length in digits of two bases is found by log<sub>x</sub>(y), where x and y are the bases being compared. log<sub>2</sub>(10) = 3.32, so numbers represented in base 2 have on average 3.32 times more digits than when they are represented in base 10. I was personally expecting this number to be higher, and I was definitely expecting it to be higher when comparing base 10 and base 36: log<sub>10</sub>(36) is only 1.56. Although our brains are <a href="https://www.science20.com/news_articles/logarithm_versus_linear_thinking_why_our_brains_midpoint_1_and_9_might_be_3-94891">wired to think in logarithms</a>, I guess I was expecting the difference to be more like the division of 36 / 10 = 3.6 times longer, but numbers are only 1.56x longer in base 10 compared to 36. Even bases in the hundreds are only between 2 and 3 times shorter digits-wise versus base 10. When picking a base to use every day, you want some balance between the number of digits in the base (how much you have to memorize to do math) and the compactness of the base (how long it takes to write out numbers). Higher bases are more compact, but not much more, and you have to learn a lot more to do math &#8211; you&#8217;ll probably to memorize all of the multiplications between nonzero single-digit numbers at least, and that number of multiplications is order O(n^2) where n is the base number. Specifically, the number of unique single-digit multiplications for a base is given by (n^2)/2 + n/2. For a sense of scale, that makes 1 unique multiplication in base 2, 45 in base 10, and 630 in base 36. It is completely unreasonable for everyone to memorize 630 numbers &#8211; even 45 seems like a lot in 3rd grade. Maybe less is better (I would be doing a disservice if I didn&#8217;t link <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=seximal">this video</a> somewhere in this post, which tackles practical usability of bases in extreme detail Also, mentioned therein is a concept called &#8220;radix economy&#8221; which as best I understand attempts to quantify the relative data storage requirements of a given base, and is a whole different rabbit hole). It&#8217;s also worth mentioning that the best base for a given society is tied to the average number of things that people in that society have to be able to count. For a hunter-gatherer society, that number is very low, so base 1 (tally marks) might be optimal. I would expect that the largest shift of &#8220;average number of things, for things that I have to count&#8221; happened with the agricultural revolution, and has only been increasing since then.)</p>



<p>Note: From here on, all numbers in base 36 (aka 10, the representation for any base in the base). Capitalized letters on their own are probably actually numbers, and numbers aren&#8217;t what you think at first glance!</p>



<p>Anyways, back to math. We need to add some rules so that we don&#8217;t have to work with long chains of 1 + &#8230;.. 1. The first rule is that we can learn some new multiplications, namely those where the result is less than 10. This includes multiplications with the digits we&#8217;re used to, and with the digits we&#8217;re not (on either side of the equation). For multiplications between digits we&#8217;re used to, we can convert the result using the chart (this is another case of using base A we&#8217;re letting slide to make things a bit easier). For multiplications involving new digits, we can add a row to the chart that shows the result. There are actually a very small number of multiplications that involve digits greater than 9 have a result less than 10, and none that involve any numbers greater than 4 (4 * 9 = 10, so anything greater than 9 is 2 digits when multiplied by 4). So we can just add &#8220;times 2&#8221; and &#8220;times 3&#8221; rows. Here&#8217;s what our chart ends up looking like:</p>

<p>(Right click -&gt; open image in new tab to view in more detail. Notice each number is &#8220;digits&#8221;, not &#8220;value&#8221;. This is to drive a point home that you almost certainly already realized: It is impossible to write/communicate values, we can only write/communicate representations of them in various different bases. The correct meaning only comes across if both sides know the base, symbols, and mapping of symbols to values, involved.)</p>



<p>The second (and last) new rule is a clever one. I call it &#8220;incrementing&#8221; or &#8220;decrementing&#8221;. </p>



<p>Z * 1 = 0Z (leading zero normally not shown)</p>



<p>Z * 2 = 1Y</p>



<p>Z * 3 = 2X</p>



<p>Notice any pattern?</p>



<p>A similar sequence in base A:</p>



<p>9 * 1 = 09<br>9 * 2 = 18<br>9 * 3 = 27</p>



<p>In both of these, the 10&#8217;s place increases by 1 and the 1&#8217;s place decreases by 1 for each larger number. Take a second and try to figure out the rule to generalize this behavior before you look at it below. This sequence, back to base 10, might also help:</p>



<p>Y * 1 = 0Y</p>



<p>Y * 2 = 1W</p>



<p>Y * 3 = 2U</p>



<p>Here is the rule:</p>



<p>(10 &#8211; x1) * x2  = (x2 * 10) &#8211; (x2 * x1)</p>



<p>Base A: 9 * 2 = (10 * 2) &#8211; (1 * 2) = 20 &#8211; 2 = 18</p>



<p>Z * 3 = (10 * 3) &#8211; (3 * 1) = 30 &#8211; 3 = 2X</p>



<p>Y * 2 = (10 * 2) &#8211; (2 * 2) = 20 &#8211; 4 = 2W</p>



<p>U * 6 = (10 * 6) &#8211; (6 * 6) = 60 &#8211; 10 = 50</p>



<p>Explained in words, this gives us a way to drastically simplify multiplications between a number under 10 and some smaller number. The rule actually works for any two numbers, but it only really saves you time if you&#8217;re multiplying something a bit under 10 with a small number. This rule basically transforms a multiplication into a subtraction; you only need to know the results of multiplications that are almost always less than 10, and 10 minus that result. This rule will make a lot more sense once we actually start using it.</p>



<p>To recap, we can use the following rules:</p>



<p>1. Breaking down numbers into constituents (addition)</p>



<p>2. (x, followed by n zeros) * (y, followed by m zeros) = x * y, followed by (n+m) zeros</p>



<p>4. Multiplications with a result below A</p>



<p>5. Incrementing / decrementing</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>For now, I stopped after figuring out multiplication and wrote the calculator program. Maybe I&#8217;ll get to division eventually, but it would just be more of the same as multiplication: develop algorithms and apply them, which I already did in a vastly more repeatable way by writing them into code. Some notes, though:</p>



<p>There are way more non-repeating decimals in base 10 compared to base A because of how many more factors base 10 has. We are used to everything without a 5 or 2 involved being repeating. In base 10, there are 7 factors instead of two: 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, C, I. Also, 3 being a factor means there are a <em>lot</em> more finite, multi-digit decimals (in base A, 1 / 4 = 0.25. Four isn&#8217;t a factor of 10, but 2 is a factor of both 10 and 4, so 1 / 4 is non-repeating. Every multiple of 3 is like this in base 36.). I&#8217;d encourage you to play with factors and decimals in the calculator and see what comes up.</p>



<p>A side endeavor of the above efforts was thinking about bases even crazier and less practical than base 36. Fractional or decimal bases were discounted pretty quick because you have to bend the definition of a base by a lot; bases are normally defined as having the same number of symbols as the value that 10 represents in that base. You won&#8217;t really get anywhere if you try to build a number system with 1/2 or 0.1 symbols. However, you can make something half-sensible if you use n = reciprocal of the base digits. That would mean 2 digits (0 and 1) for base 1/2. You can represent all real numbers this way; the representation of any number is just the number in base 2 but flipped over the decimal place (because 1/2 = 2^-1, and (x^-1)^-1 = 1). So fractional bases where the fraction is a reciprocal of an integer are kind of just boring. I might revisit non-integer-reciprocal fractional bases (be careful not to say this term around any normal person with who you might want to talk to in the future because they will be around you in the future only when compelled to by an authority figure) in the future if I&#8217;m especially tired of working on things that have any minuscule semblance of a real-world application.</p>



<p>My final stop so far on the road of impractical bases was negative bases. These sort of have the same problem above &#8211; you obviously can&#8217;t have negative two symbols in a base system &#8211; but hold more interest because it&#8217;s not immediately apparent whether all real, or even integer, numbers can be represented. For base -2, the 1&#8217;s digit is 1&#8217;s, the 10&#8217;s digit is how many -2&#8217;s there are, but then the twos digit is how many +4&#8217;s there are, because a negative times a negative is a positive. So the value flip flops between positive and negative at each place in a given number. Here is a list of the first few base -2 numbers and their decimal representations.</p>



<p>0       0<br>1         1<br>10    -2<br>11      -1<br>100   4<br>101     5<br>110     2<br>111       3<br>1000 -8<br>1001   -7<br>1010   -10<br>1011     -9<br>1100    -4<br></p>



<p>So.. At least there are no repeats, which is nice?? But on the other hand, we&#8217;ve gone up to the 13th number in the sequence, and 6 hasn&#8217;t even shown up yet&#8230;</p>



<p>It turns out there&#8217;s actually a very beautiful pattern going on here, and to you who has come so far, I&#8217;d like you to try and figure out what type of sequence it might be before scrolling down. No code to help out this time.</p>

<p>That no code thing was kind of a lie, I did write some to plot the value represented in base -2 on the y axis and value represented in base 2 on the x axis (aka the nth number in base -2 or base 2). This code can be found as neg2.py in the <a href="https://github.com/pwspen/numerical_bases">same directory as the base calculator</a> if you want to play with it. Here are the first 10 numbers.</p>

<p>Hmm.. Well, we know it&#8217;s right because it lines up with the list above: y(0) = 0, y(1) = 1, y(2) = -2, etc. <br>But that&#8217;s sure a weird shape. There&#8217;s two parallelogram shapes, and it looks like all the numbers above about 8 are out of our view (this is on purpose). It looks like there&#8217;s an upwards trend though, so maybe they&#8217;re above 5? Let&#8217;s expand the view to 20..</p>

<p>Nope, turns out they were actually way negative. And they made another of the same shape. And then the next few made another of that shape and were a bit less negative. And now, the four shapes almost look like they&#8217;re making up a bigger version of the same shape. Wait, does that mean&#8230;</p>

<p>Glancing quickly at this graph and the one above it, you would think I pasted the same image twice. But there are a lot more dots in the second one. A whole lot more dots. </p>



<p>It might look like a pattern that has 4-way symmetry instead of 2, but really it just reverses direction every other&#8230; rectangle? point? Who knows. At the smallest level you can see that each group is made up of two things (dots, or rectangles, fractal don&#8217;t care). Presumably the other negative bases are the same: n groupings at the smallest level, and zig-zagging after every grouping. Here&#8217;s the -3 fractal for 100,000 terms:</p>

<p>Now that the groupings are more numerous, it makes it easier to discern some properties of the general shape. We can see that it appears to hit all integers, in a roundabout way (This is confirmed with more detailed analysis of the data set). We&#8217;re at n=100,000 and it looks like it&#8217;s only gotten up to positive 20,000 or so, but we know it&#8217;ll hit those numbers on the next pass when it starts going up instead of down at the largest level.</p>



<p>Also, the biggest zig-zags are always on powers of the base. 2^16 = 65536, 3^10 = 59049, both graphs make a &#8220;turn&#8221; at the highest level right around those numbers. This actually makes a ton of sense: The negative bases flip-flop, and the largest flip flops are when they get a new digit added on the front, which either makes the whole number very positive when it was very negative, or vice versa.</p>



<p>Another interesting property is that these fractals hit all the positive <em>and </em>negative integers as outputs with just the positive integers as inputs. </p>



<p>I haven&#8217;t graphed this, but the fractal continues down below 1 on the negative x&#8217;s side. There, it would approach zero as x approaches negative infinity (an increasingly negative exponent always means something is approaching zero. The exponent isn&#8217;t 1:1 with the x value, but it is corelated (something to do with the log of something&#8230;)). The maximum and minimum bounds on the above graphs sure look like y = x and y = -x to me, but this asymptotic behavior suggests they&#8217;re not quite linear, even if they look like that for large scales. It&#8217;s interesting that this behavior is different from positive bases, which cover all of the negative numbers on the left side of the graph, and all of the numbers -1 &lt; x &lt; 1 right around zero. Instead, negative fractals take the whole left side of the graph -inf &lt; x &lt; 0 for fractions, and the whole right side 0 &lt; x &lt; inf for integers.</p>



<p>And this is where it ends, for now. If you have read this far you might be interested in continuing down the rabbit hole. My next steps if I ever get to them (unlikely) will be looking at the left side of the above fractals, then trying to extend the &#8220;base&#8221; function to be continuous (using the log function somehow), like the gamma function is for factorials, and then seeing if there&#8217;s anything special about decimal/fractional bases (probably not), (integer + decimal) bases (maybe?), and negative decimal/fractional bases (who the hell knows)(I&#8217;m sure there are some great youtube videos out there on at least a couple of those, but figuring out yourself is so much more fun (and time consuming)). I really want to see what the interpolation of the fractal plots looks like. If f(2) and f(3) are so clearly different and well defined on their own, what does halfway between them look like (f(2.5))? My guess is a random smattering of dots that doesn&#8217;t look particularly like either, but only one way to know for sure.</p>



<p>To finally conclude this post: One of the coolest things I figured out through this process was that 1 with any number of trailing zeros is the only number that does the same thing in all bases. I count it as trivial math, which means it&#8217;s kind of self-evident and not much of a discovery (multiplication by 1 with a number of zeros following it is part of how bases are defined in the first place), similar to x * 0 = 0, but it&#8217;s still cool. The friend I was working on this with had a new favorite number after we finished: 10. One-zero, not ten!</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a tiny cylinder of glass, 2mm diameter by 12mm, with some electronic chips inside: <a href="https://dangerousthings.com/product/next/" rel="nofollow">https://dangerousthings.com/product/next/</a><br><br>I got it implanted a year ago to the day, so it&#8217;s my cyborgiversary! I don&#8217;t actually think I&#8217;m a cyborg, it&#8217;s just fun to say, and has a nice shock factor to it. I think most people would probably consider me a cyborg though, so maybe I actually am by majority rule. </p>



<p>But there&#8217;s really not much different from my implant than tattoos, piercings, or medical implants. The first two have been around for thousands of years, and none of the three are particularly strange now, even across class and gender divisions (there are always hold-outs for the &#8220;traditional ways&#8221;, but times have already changed for the most part, at least in the US). Tattoos and piercings are <em>mostly</em> aesthetic and cultural, without function &#8211; that culture being at any and all levels from personal to global. Medical implants are functional-only in the vast majority of cases, entirely divorced from culture. </p>



<p>Chip implants are in an interesting middle ground &#8211; functional <em>and</em> cultural. I don&#8217;t think there are very many people who get a chip implant and don&#8217;t interact at all with the &#8220;biohacker&#8221; culture surrounding them, and also very few people who get a chip implant only because of cultural or personal expression reasons and don&#8217;t use it at all. </p>



<p>As for actual capabilities, they&#8217;re not particularly impressive. I basically just have <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Contactless-Access-13-56MHz-ISO14443-Reader/dp/B0892G81QD">two of these</a> in my hand, one each for RFID and NFC. RFID is mostly used for access control to activate things that you&#8217;d usually carry an access card around for, and NFC mostly to do simple things on smartphones, like pull up a link or pop up a message on screen. There are other types of implants, ranging from financial/payment to LEDs to magnets to temperature sensors, and various more interesting and less proven offerings outside of the &#8220;consumer&#8221; realm (I&#8217;d estimate that Dangerous Things has sells mid triple to low quadruple digit implants yearly, so they&#8217;re not exactly Facebook). </p>



<p>But none of them are magic. The only time the electronics in mine are active is when they&#8217;re millimeters away from an antenna that is scanning them, because they don&#8217;t have any internal battery, instead being powered entirely from transmitted power of the scanning antenna. I can&#8217;t get into anywhere that I didn&#8217;t already have a key card for. I can&#8217;t hack into any locked phones or even cause much of a threat to unlocked ones other than linking them to a virus-infested site. And there&#8217;s definitely no one <a href="https://pwspencer.com/2022/12/24/the-lie-we-tell-ourselves/">tracking or controlling me</a> in any way. The first one is much closer to reality than the second, but a big hurdle that stands firmly in the way of any active implanted electronics is the current lack of biocompatible batteries. Batteries tend to outgas which poses a problem for keeping them in sealed glass capsules, and more broadly stored energy likes to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsuYxFBHsiQ">release</a> <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/samsung-finally-explains-galaxy-note-7-exploding-battery-mess-n710581">itself</a> <a href="https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1502653">sporadically</a> in ways that would not be exactly comfortable or healthy were it happening under your skin. (This is a hurdle that has been cleared in some medical contexts like pacemakers because of an orders-of-magnitude funding difference between medical and non-medical implants.)</p>



<p>For most implantables, there are wearables that can do the same job without sticking anything into yourself. My implant could just as easily be a ring and it would actually work <em>better</em> because of the larger antenna size &#8211; I have to smush my hand against the scanning antenna for any hope of the chips being read, and even then I need to wiggle my hand around a bit to find the right position. </p>



<p>So why get an implant at all?</p>



<p>There are some meager functional benefits. I can misplace a ring, just like I frequently misplace my wallet, but I can&#8217;t misplace my hand! For a semester, I lived in a dorm where I needed an access card to get into my room, and many a time my implant saved me a walk down to the reception desk when I left my wallet in my room. If I&#8217;m ever at any type of conference or convention in the future, I can pop up links to a website or profile with a wave. Maybe most importantly, I can rick roll friends with my hand. </p>



<p>But I also just like it. I enjoy the feeling of autonomy that it reinforces; that my body is mine to do whatever I want with it; that I can take personal responsibility for the risk evaluation that is usually placed on doctors (see the addendum about this at the end of this post). I like that it makes me think about the future. It just plain feels cool.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s interesting to me that many people are taken aback by my implant, many that would probably also be taken aback by the decision <em>not </em>to get a medical implant. The risks are really no more than an ear piercing, and it&#8217;s much less noticeable than one. I can&#8217;t feel it at all. I think the reason it gets a reaction is that it is functional in a non-medical way. It <em>extends</em> functionality instead of <em>replacing</em> it. </p>



<p>But should it?</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t really see my implant as any different than cars, computers, or airplanes, which also clearly extend functionality. But no one thinks twice about these things. Why are extending general functionality and replacing bodily functionality both normal, but extending bodily functionality is not? The body might be sacred to some, but it can&#8217;t be <em>that</em> sacred if you&#8217;ll put a pacemaker or titanium rod in it when push comes to shove.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to modifying my body more in the future, in conventional and unconventional ways. I think it would be a waste of a perfectly good meat suit to not try to spruce it up a bit before it&#8217;s defunct.</p>



<p></p>

<p>Addendum: Broad bodily autonomy</p>



<p>I fully respect those who do not want anything &#8220;unnatural&#8221; in their bodies, even lifesaving medical interventions like pacemakers. Bodily autonomy is important for everyone, not just people who <em>do</em> want to modify their bodies.</p>



<p><br>Addendum: Health impacts</p>



<p>This is something that is most people&#8217;s concern after &#8220;that&#8217;s really weird&#8221; &#8211; it was definitely mine when I heard about it. As far as I know, no non-medical implants are approved or sanctioned by any government agency or medical practitioners, so it is definitely &#8220;at your own risk&#8221;. However, that risk isn&#8217;t really any greater than an ear or face piercing. </p>



<p>Much of the following is about my specific implant type, but most of it applies to implants generally. </p>



<p><a href="https://forum.dangerousthings.com/t/tests-weve-performed-on-our-x-series-tags/474">A large variety of tests</a> have been performed on the implant type encompassing mine. It arrived in a syringe, which was pre-sterilized and sealed inside packaging, only opened very shortly before it is used. It is easily removable from wherever it is implanted/installed in the rare event that it cracks, stops working, or causes medical problems (which is extremely unlikely because the glass housing is completely inert biologically, and not &#8220;seen&#8221; by the immune system. I have not read any accounts of infection or rejection issues from installations by experienced piercers.) </p>



<p>As for breaking and shattering concerns, I haven&#8217;t smashed my hand very hard in the year I&#8217;ve had the implant, but I have read accounts of people who have done everything up to and including literally smashing the implant with a hammer, and haven&#8217;t heard any accounts of the glass housing ever breaking (although the last time I looked was a year ago). There are very limited accounts of electronics ceasing to function, partly from user error and partly not (I don&#8217;t think my specific implant would be simple to brick even if I was trying), but having to remove or replace an implant isn&#8217;t really an item of concern when contrasted with removing hundreds of tiny glass shards from your hand.</p>



<p>Anecdotally, the only pain, discomfort, or even inconvenience that I have been caused is when getting stuck with the needle in the first place. It&#8217;s kind of a dauntingly large needle compared to normal medical needles, but the pain wasn&#8217;t that bad, not even really noticeably worse than getting vaccinated or having blood drawn. I do have a tiny scar from the installation, in the circle to the right of the implant:</p>

<p>It is located just under the skin and resting on the muscles/cartilage, so I can shift it around a decent amount. I can push it about 25% of its length side-to-side, up to about its full length axially depending on the position of my thumb, and tilt it up maybe 30° by pushing down on either end. I feel almost nothing from doing this, other than what anyone feels if they gently press on one hand with the other. There is a slight feeling of pressure against the muscle/cartilage when pressing the implant down into my hand, and an interesting sensation that I assume is the separation and recombination of muscle fibers when moving it side to side while pressing down on it. No matter how I move or press on it, even laying against a hard surface and my other hand pressing with full force, there is no implant-caused pain.</p>



<p>Note that attention to medical concerns will vary drastically depending on the source, which is one of the reasons I bought from one of the largest, if not the largest, non-medical implant companies, and had it installed by a piercer familiar with the brand. There are also more medical concerns with larger implants. </p>



<p>Most implants won&#8217;t have enough metal to really stick out on any sort of security scanner (not that they are illegal anyways), or cause any problems during medical procedures like MRIs. Magnetic implants might be different in both cases, but even then <a href="https://forum.dangerousthings.com/t/fingertip-titan-in-an-mri/16503">anecdotally you&#8217;ll be fine.</a> (Magnetic implants are very interesting, adding a way to pseudo-sense magnetic fields, and I don&#8217;t think it will be long before I have one myself.)</p>



<p>There are risks involved in everything. For chip implants and my personal level of risk tolerance, there doesn&#8217;t seem to be anything worth worrying about.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>All of the ideas in this post originated from one question: How is <em>this</em> possible?<br>&#8220;This&#8221; is something you&#8217;re currently experiencing, and actually the only thing you&#8217;ve ever experienced: Experience itself. Thinking, sensing, doing. Terms like consciousness and sentience can be ambiguous, so I&#8217;ll be using &#8220;conscious experience&#8221; instead (&#8220;phenomenal experience&#8221; works pretty well but isn&#8217;t self-explanatory).</p>



<p>So, how is it possible? I think everyone has to find their own answer to that, but this is mine.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m not religious and don&#8217;t believe in anyone having any type of spirit or soul; to me, this experience and my brain are one and the same thing. If you have a fully functioning brain, you <em>will</em> have fully functioning cognition and experience of reality, and you can&#8217;t have that without a fully functioning brain. (&#8220;Fully functioning&#8221; is in extremely general terms where pretty much every person somewhat capable of living a normal life is included). In other words, <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/zombies/">zombies</a> can&#8217;t exist. The brain and the mind being different things is an illusion.</p>



<p>But something doesn&#8217;t feel right. Experience and matter don&#8217;t seem to be the same thing at all. How can any amount or coordination of molecular interactions cause matter to experience reality? </p>



<p>This is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_problem_of_consciousness">hard problem of consciousness</a> and there&#8217;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_problem_of_consciousness#Proposed_solutions">many different answers</a> out there. I highly recommend reading some of them. </p>



<p>I can&#8217;t bring myself to believe that my experience is created entirely from inert matter (materialism), that the mind is somehow distinct from the brain (dualism), or that all matter/reality is constructed by or extensions of minds (idealism).</p>



<p>This leaves me with a strange answer: matter has some part or quality to it that <em>is </em>conscious experience. And there&#8217;s nothing much special about the matter in brains of living things, so I mean <em>all</em> matter. I earnestly believe that rocks (or at least the elementary particles in them) have an experience of reality. This is called panpsychism.</p>



<p>This is about the point when people start to back away, saying &#8220;wow&#8230; that&#8217;s suuuper cool&#8230;&#8221;, or <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/panpsychism/#IncrStar">stare at me incredulously.</a></p>



<p>But I ask you to do one thing: Mark where exactly the line is that separates conscious experience from lack of it. Humans have it, but nothing else does? Great apes and whales only? Animals only? Life only?</p>



<p>For every line drawn, there will be some things below the line (without conscious experience) very similar to things above the line, and it is unclear what they lack. If humans only, what about our ancestor hominids? Did a mind simply pop into one of them one day a few millions of years ago? If only great apes and whales, what about related but maybe somewhat less intelligent animals, like dolphins or gibbons? There&#8217;s never going to be much difference between living things at the borders of definitions. If you make jumps from the simplest single-celled life to humans, no single jump is all that large. The extreme of this is that the very simplest life is not <em>that</em> different from its constituent chemicals, were they not part of a lifeform &#8211; if you believe life on Earth began by random chance, that was just from some complex chemicals smacking into each other in just the right way. Nothing fundamentally changed about the atoms/quarks involved.</p>



<p>Something either has experience or it does not. There is no gray area, no halfway, no in-between. But trying to draw a line anywhere along the tree of life (or between the tree and the soil from which it grew, or even between different types of soil), ends up with two similar forms, but one of them has experience, and the other does not. It doesn&#8217;t make sense to me that such a distinct property would arise because of very small differences between forms (chaos theory be damned). So I don&#8217;t believe that the line exists.</p>



<p>A belief I hold that complements this line of reasoning pretty well is that there are <em>extremely</em> few things, in any context, that are truly digital &#8211; on or off, one or zero. When you flip a light switch, your room goes through every single intermediary light level between &#8220;light&#8221; and &#8220;dark&#8221;, no person is entirely bad or entirely good, and even literal digital signals fluctuate by tiny amounts from &#8220;off&#8221; and &#8220;on&#8221;. So it makes sense to me that conscious experience also wouldn&#8217;t work in that way; instead it is a continuous spectrum.</p>



<p>I do <em>not</em> believe that single particles have intelligence or ability to reason anything close to that of even the most basic living thing &#8211; just that they have some unimaginably basic experience of reality. I do have some guesses about what that experience of reality might be like, though: &#8220;Senses&#8221; might be base quantities like energy and its transfer &#8211; the force of interactions with other particles, which we experience in an extremely indirect way through our senses (the sense of touching an object is the perception of the electromagnetic force between the atoms in your hand and the atoms of the object). I have a deterministic view so I don&#8217;t believe that particles would have free will (just like we don&#8217;t), but a motor action (for us, the contraction of muscles) that might be available to a particle is &#8220;choosing&#8221; to radioactively decay into other particles. That &#8220;choosing&#8221; would be a function of the particle&#8217;s &#8220;senses&#8221;, but I won&#8217;t speculate what the function is.</p>



<p>There are still problems related to the initial question of &#8220;how is this possible?&#8221;: how do all the extremely basic experiences of the particles in my brain seamlessly combine to form such a complex and vivid one? This is called the &#8220;<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/panpsychism/#CombProb">combination problem</a>&#8220;, and it&#8217;s the &#8220;hard problem&#8221; wearing a different outfit. I don&#8217;t have a great answer. It exists even at the lowest level &#8211; above, I used an example of an atom &#8220;choosing&#8221; &#8211; atoms are themselves composites of protons, neutrons and electrons, and protons and neutrons are <em>themselves</em> composites of quarks. My best explanation is that all matter is in and causes perturbations in a &#8220;consciousness field&#8221; (once again discarding something discrete &#8211; entirely separate consciousnesses &#8211; for something continuous), and certain matter arrangements (inside of brains, for example) aligns (as in magnets) and creates a stronger perturbation. But do the individual smaller consciousnesses still exist? A field implies that there is only a single consciousness in the entire universe (this is called cosmopsychism), but my conscious experience <em>very much</em> feels separate at some level from others&#8217;. Is this just an illusion? Either way, we still have a problem, we maybe just traded in &#8220;combination&#8221; for &#8220;<em>de</em>combination&#8221;. </p>



<p>One thing that strengthens my belief in panpsychism is that every time humans think they&#8217;re special, we turn out to be wrong. We&#8217;re learning more and more that some animals are <em>very </em>intelligent, for example. Cetaceans in particular have group-specific cultures, dialects, and prey, actively teach their young, live in extremely close social groups, and use tools. Orcas in particular have <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_animals_by_number_of_neurons#List_of_animal_species_by_forebrain_(cerebrum_or_pallium)_neuron_number">twice as many cerebral neurons</a> </em>as us (cerebral neurons are arguably a decent indicator of ability for cognition, and the next-closest primate is the western gorilla with about half as many cerebral neurons as us). The parts of their brain that process emotions are also more developed than ours. It seems to me like there&#8217;s a pretty good chance that something with superhuman intelligence is living right next to us. </p>



<p>Although I do think we are one of the most intelligent animals on the planet (there&#8217;s a whole &#8216;nother post in here talking about how there is actually no such thing as &#8220;most intelligent&#8221; when it&#8217;s not really something that can even be objectively &#8220;better&#8221; or &#8220;worse&#8221; but I&#8217;m going to leave that alone for now), we&#8217;re maybe not the <em>most</em>, and certainly not as far above other animals as we like to think. Knowing this, it seems a little silly to take the same dubious idea of superiority and apply it between life and inert matter. </p>



<p>There&#8217;s another very interesting area where &#8220;human exceptionalism&#8221; is prominent: artificial intelligence. I&#8217;ve been extremely impressed with recent AI, and firmly believe large language models like GPT-3, various image generators, and as-yet unknown applications of the same basics are going to change the world within the next decade, and there&#8217;s already a good bit of debate on what the development of the field is going to look like, and what its limits might be, especially in regard to conscious experience &#8211; can computers ever hope to experience like we do?</p>



<p>Broken down to the lowest level, current artificial intelligence is only performing simple calculations and running algorithms- flipping bits according to code. That doesn&#8217;t <em>sound</em> very intelligent, but very interesting behaviors emerge from a (very) large number of these basic actions. It can write you a rhyming poem speaking like Donald Trump, write novel code, create convincing human faces that don&#8217;t exist, and interactively explain things. Of course, all of this is because of the massive amounts of training data it has access to, but it still seems to be undeniably able to combine concepts to create entirely novel work, very similar to but still unique from its training data. </p>



<p>Our brains, on the other hand, have billions (about 86 billion) neurons in them, and each neuron has thousands of connections to other neurons. As a unit, each neuron behaves simply, firing or not based on basic electrical and chemical criteria, and the brain&#8217;s complex behavior and conscious experience is a result of coordinated firing of many, many simple neurons. Everything that any life form has have ever done, felt, or thought happens this way.</p>



<p>For modern-day AI, extremely basic calculations cause very complex emergent behavior.</p>



<p>A brains&#8217; basic unit of computation is simple, but unimaginably many of them intertwined combine to create very complex emergent behavior, and a conscious experience.</p>



<p>How are these two things fundamentally different?</p>



<p>Personally, I don&#8217;t think they are, which leads me to believe that current AIs have some level conscious experience.</p>



<p>It doesn&#8217;t stop there. The original title of this post was going to be &#8220;your computer is thinking&#8221;. A few paragraphs back, I talked about matter aligning in certain ways to create a higher level of conscious experience, and I don&#8217;t think that the alignment of silicon transistors in a CPU is meaningfully different in this way than the alignment of neurons in the brain. Under panpsychism, the only conclusion I can reach is that anything that is arranged to do computation has a meaningfully higher level of conscious experience than something like a rock that isn&#8217;t aligned in that way. I also believe that level of conscious experience can and will change based on the state of the system, that is, artificial intelligence has a meaningfully higher level of conscious experience than the same computational hardware just running, like, Chrome. I&#8217;m not exactly sure what the analog to this is in biological brains- maybe doing actions requiring intense focus, maybe doing drugs? Either way, I think most people would agree that they have had a differing conscious experience (whatever that means) at various points in their lives. We&#8217;re getting down in the weeds.</p>



<p>To conclude: I wouldn&#8217;t throw away panpsychism as quickly as you might want to just because it feels wrong or strange; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation">some things about reality are just plain weird.</a> I believe in panpsychism because I don&#8217;t have any good answers to the following questions: Why would humans, or life in general, be so special as to uniquely have conscious experience, when we&#8217;re composed of the exact same stuff as the rest of the universe? How can a conscious experience be created from matter that has nothing of the sort? If you have a good answer to either question, I&#8217;d love to hear it, please leave it in a comment!</p>



<p></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide" />



<p></p>



<p>Appendix</p>



<p>There are variants of panpsychism where all matter is conscious, and variants where all matter just has some element or quality that <em>can</em> create consciousness, but is not necessarily conscious in itself. I believe the former mainly because it seems <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor">simpler than the latter</a>. However, the latter does allow for the possibility that only some range of things are conscious- like all living things, all living things surpassing some level of brain capacity, or even just humans. I personally don&#8217;t believe in any of those for already stated reasons, and in lieu of needing to satisfy any of those requirements, the simpler option seems more likely.</p>



<p><br>I don&#8217;t believe that current AI is anywhere close to a human level of conscious experience, and it seems very difficult to compare &#8220;computer experience&#8221; to &#8220;biological experience&#8221; to try and see how close they are by comparing neuron and transistor counts &#8211; there&#8217;s not really two units that do the same thing that you can compare. Neurons are relatively large in terms of connections (being connected to about 15,000 other neurons on average in the human brain) and fire relatively slowly, a few tens of times per second. Transistors are relatively small with only two inputs and one output, and can fire <em>billions</em> of times per second. Maybe it makes a bit more sense to compare synapses (neurons&#8217; connections to other neurons) and transistors, but still not a lot. That said, here are some calculations comparing human synapse count and transistor count:<br>~86 billion neurons, ~15,000 synapses per = ~ 1.29 * 10^15 synapses</p>



<p>Everyday device: ~ 10*^11 transistors</p>



<p>Order-of-magnitude difference: ~10^4 = 10,000x less transistors</p>



<p>I wanted to repeat this calculation for the current most-powerful supercomputer but couldn&#8217;t find any transistor counts, but the most powerful in 2016 had about:</p>



<p>400 trillion = 4 * 10^14</p>



<p>Order-of-magnitude difference: &lt;1 (similar) </p>



<p>The takeaway from this is that supercomputers by now almost certainly have more transistors than there are synapses in the human brain (you could prove this if you knew how many transistors per component in the current most powerful supercomputer, which is almost certainly public information, but I don&#8217;t want to go and do a bunch of multiplication for this dubious of a comparison). Everyday devices are about a quarter century away if Moore&#8217;s law continues (2^(25/2) ~~= 10,000). The type of computer that current consumer AI models (like GPT3) run on is definitely closer to supercomputers than phones or laptops, so it&#8217;s feasible that consumer AI today uses more neurons than there are synapses in the human brain, and one side of that comparison is increasing ~exponentially while the other remains fixed. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s fair to draw any real conclusions from this without more scrutiny.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I worked at a pet shop in high school, and we had a frequent customer who would come in and mumble about the FBI and how he was being watched, while recording himself. I didn&#8217;t really know what he was doing or feeling at the time, I just knew I didn&#8217;t want to go near him! Years later, I got myself a microchip in my hand, then learned about people who believe they had been implanted with thins against their will that speak to them, control them, and generally make their lives nightmares: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62s3FinAoC0">&#8220;targeted individuals&#8221;</a>. Not all of them believe they have been chipped, but they do all believe that they are being harassed or controlled  by a person or organization. Sometimes this is through &#8220;normal&#8221; technology like GPS trackers and cameras, sometimes it&#8217;s through things like mind control implants or psychic powers, and sometimes there&#8217;s no technology involved at all, just everyone focusing on and harassing them everywhere they go. </p>



<p>99%+ of the time (all of the time for experiences involving nonexistent technology like implantable, tiny GPS trackers or mind control chips), these are symptoms of schizophrenia or related mental conditions. When you tell this to a &#8220;targeted individual&#8221;, they are usually thankful that their problems are solved, and immediately make an appointment with a psychiatrist. </p>



<p>Nope.. you&#8217;re actually just adding to the pile of people who have already told them that they&#8217;re &#8220;crazy&#8221; and &#8220;losing their grip on reality&#8221;. Maybe you&#8217;re even in on the harassment, trying to stop you from seeking <em>real </em>help so you can continue to torment them. Their doctors definitely are- they won&#8217;t believe a single word about the undeniably <em>real</em> harassment that you experience when you&#8217;re targeted. Why won&#8217;t anyone listen? The whole world must be in on it. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Truman_Show_delusion#:~:text=The%20Truman%20Show%20delusion%2C%20also,are%20being%20watched%20on%20cameras.">Maybe they&#8217;re even making a TV show about you.</a></p>



<p>But&#8230; Can you blame them? The essence of &#8220;mental illness&#8221;, &#8220;mental disorder&#8221;, and &#8220;schizophrenia&#8221; is <em>crazy</em>, and <em>crazy</em> is a very bad thing to be. Bipolar, PTSD, even more common things like depression and anxiety still don&#8217;t mean a whole lot more than <em>crazy</em> and <em>wrong</em>. How can you be crazy when you have friends, go to the bar on weekends, and work out every day? Those are normal people things, not the actions of a crazy person. Would you believe someone that told you that the abuse and damage being done to you is a figment of your imagination? I don&#8217;t think I would, I would probably tell that person to fuck off. What if that&#8217;s all that anyone ever tells you, even your loved ones?</p>



<p>There is a lie deeply ingrained in our culture and that we all have to tell ourselves at some level, and it is that our experience of the world <em>is equal to</em> the objective, external world that everyone experiences &#8211; basically, that we can ever fully &#8220;trust our senses&#8221;. </p>



<p>But it&#8217;s not, we can&#8217;t, and the &#8220;external world&#8221; is foreign to us (if it even exists!). </p>

<p>Close your left eye and look at the circle with your right eye. Move towards and away from the screen until you find the distance at which the cross disappears, probably between six inches and 2 feet depending on the size of the screen you&#8217;re reading this on.</p>



<p>You might&#8217;ve heard about it, but you probably never noticed this blind spot unless you&#8217;ve already seen one of these tricks to make something disappear. The reason for that is that our brains are <em>extremely</em> good at masking these vision dead zones (one per eye), and other impediments to our sight and other senses. The point is: the brain, our mind, is an unreliable narrator of the &#8220;external world&#8221; even for completely healthy, normal people. Our senses are based on incomplete information, and our experience is a reconstruction of those senses that is unique to every person, and assuming that it is a completely correct reconstruction would cause you to believe that the cross blips off your screen for <em>everyone</em> when you move your head a certain way. It would also cause you to believe in other &#8220;reconstruction errors&#8221;: that everyone is judging you because of your beat-up shoes, that your keys were stolen by the gnomes because you can&#8217;t find them right now, that you&#8217;re bound to hit the next jackpot because you&#8217;ve lost eight times in a row, that there really are things moving in your peripheral vision whenever you go a very long time without sleeping, or that your mind is being controlled by a microchip that someone implanted in your brain.</p>



<p>Experience <em>is</em> reality. No one can know what the world is like outside of their senses, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_brain">or if there even is a world at all</a>. As much as we like to trust our experiences, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solipsism">you have no actual way of telling whether you&#8217;re in the matrix, or whether anyone in the world has a mind like you do</a>. Even the most normal people have no idea what reality <em>really </em>is (and can never know) &#8211; Colors, sounds, and all of our other senses are translations of something (electromagnetic radiation, vibrations of air molecules, etc) into terms that we can understand, and the original text is completely hidden from and foreign to us, by the nature of what we are.</p>



<p>People that experience gang stalking and being targeted <em>are actually experiencing those things</em>, they&#8217;re just not reflected in other people&#8217;s experiences. No doctor or scan would be able to find advanced technology in their bodies, but they are still being spoken to by the microchip in their brain, in exactly the same way that you are spoken to every day. And they <em>are</em> being harassed by nebulous and shadowy groups, but a thorough search of the entire world for those groups would come up empty-handed. It just happens that the resolution for these problems is not fighting back or implant removal surgery, it&#8217;s probably psychiatric medication. </p>



<p>The only reality that exists is perception. I think it&#8217;s natural and a simple consequence of being human to <em>feel</em> that the reality we perceive is the external world &#8211; our perception evolved to let us interact with the external world as easily as possible &#8211; but it&#8217;s very helpful to also <em>know</em> rationally that it&#8217;s only a representation of a few aspects of it. A very <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lossy_compression">lossy compression</a>.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide" />



<p>The following is meandering and somewhat repetitive thoughts on mental health as it relates to the above. </p>



<p>I think mental health destigmatization is pretty important. If &#8220;I have poor mental health&#8221; &#8211; basically, &#8220;I am crazy&#8221; &#8211; didn&#8217;t have any connotation (just like &#8220;my leg is broken&#8221; or &#8220;my head hurts&#8221; &#8211; you don&#8217;t really think of any type of person when hearing it), a lot of people would be suffering a lot less. The core thing that needs to be acknowledged is that our realities / experiences do not necessarily align with others&#8217;, and sometimes differ by amounts that cause anguish in suffering, as in schizophrenia. (Arguably, <em>all</em> human-caused suffering is caused by a misalignment between experienced realities, but that&#8217;s for another post..)</p>



<p>On the other side of the coin, sometimes mental health &#8220;issues&#8221; aren&#8217;t so much issues as just non-typical (neurodivergent). Schizophrenia has a clear negative impact on the experiences of most of its sufferers, but things like autism and ADHD are much more difficult to make a determination on. How do you decide when someone&#8217;s experienced reality is sufficiently different from most people&#8217;s as to be considered a disorder and treated, when you don&#8217;t and can&#8217;t know what their reality is like? When it starts having a negative impact? How do you judge that, especially if the person doesn&#8217;t want their reality to change? When it starts to harm other people?</p>



<p>&#8220;Reality&#8221; discussed here includes everything that we experience: senses aren&#8217;t at all separate from feelings and thoughts, it just <em>really</em> feels like it (this is why you might <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_illusion">see a word or phrase everywhere for a few days after learning it for the first time</a>). &#8220;Normal&#8221; people have an astounding variety of hobbies, opinions, likes, dislikes, habits, and feelings, and the only reason for that wonderful diversity is different realities. Some mental &#8220;disorders&#8221; can have positive effects, or at least the person doesn&#8217;t nearly think of it as a disorder. Also, all mental conditions only present in a spectrum, it&#8217;s just that labels can be pretty useful. That said, I definitely think that mental health treatment has a positive effect on the experience / life of <em>most</em> people that it is administered to, and the proportion is higher the more severe the condition is. Even if <em>nothing</em> is inherently negative or an &#8220;issue&#8221;, there certainly are conditions that cause a very large divide between your reality and others&#8217;, and that tends to cause grief unless you decide to go live in a cabin in the woods. On the most extreme end, there are conditions that cause injury or death even if you <em>do</em> live in a cabin in the woods. (If I wanted to type more, I would ask if that&#8217;s actually inherently bad, but I&#8217;ll throw that in the &#8220;think about this later&#8221; pile.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I&#8217;m fairly confident that this will apply decently to most engineering fields, but maybe not quite as well to computer/software engineering. Mostly writing this to look back on in a few years and see how my thoughts change.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m currently a senior mechanical engineering student. I have had two internships, one with a renewable energy lab in my university, and one with an aerospace startup. This information is built up from my experience applying to and working at those, as well as talking with other students about their various experiences. Note that this information is <em>very</em> colored by my interests which tend to be small companies that don&#8217;t care much about GPA, even though I&#8217;m trying to speak from a neutral position. </p>



<p>Note that this post mainly talks about GPA from the perspective of a student or recent grad. Pretty much everyone seems to agree that it holds very little importance 5+ years after graduation. Personally, I don&#8217;t think it matters much in most cases after your first full-time job.</p>



<p>First, the big myth of GPA. I don&#8217;t think it is nearly as important as most students think, depending on where they are looking to work during and after school. The a few cases where it might matter: if you want to work at an extremely competitive company with a GPA cutoff, a very large company (or department, e.g. NASA) with a cutoff, or get a Masters/PhD (especially so if you want to go into academia). However, even in those cases, I don&#8217;t think that your GPA really matters as long as you pass the cutoff. A 4.0 might get you in the door at some places, but in others it might be looked on as a slight negative if you have nothing else on your resume (the person who hired me at my startup internship told me this directly)- it shows that you chose to prioritize classes over things like projects and teams, which isn&#8217;t <em>wrong</em>, but it can be misaligned with the interests of certain companies (small ones who value practical experience, which classes generally don&#8217;t do a great job teaching you). </p>



<p>Something I&#8217;ll also note is that I don&#8217;t think that a company being competitive (and certainly not large) necessarily transfers into how much you&#8217;ll learn from the experience, or even how good it might look on your resume. The idea underlying this entire post is that practical experience trumps apparent societal indicators of hard work or intelligence, like GPA or working at a highly thought-of company. I especially don&#8217;t want to work at defense companies even though I know many people think highly of them, because the single common impression I&#8217;ve gotten from talking to people in defense is that it is slow and boring. I find that people tend to be pretty honest about their work experience at a given company if asked, so that&#8217;s my preferred method of looking past the veil of perception into what it&#8217;s actually like to work at a given place. </p>



<p>A question I&#8217;ve asked myself is, even if it doesn&#8217;t matter much, why not try to make it good, in case you end up in a situation where it does? My personal answer to that is that it will take up valuable time in which you could have been improving yourself and possibly your hire-ability in other ways, like doing personal projects or being part of an engineering student team. (If you&#8217;re choosing between 20 hours of partying every week and spending that time on your GPA, it&#8217;ll obviously be better career-wise to spend it on the GPA, although that&#8217;s a false dichotomy.) If one of the above cases doesn&#8217;t apply to you, those will give you a <em>much</em> better looking resume for the same time invested, and be much more fun, too. </p>



<p>Experience in varying engineering fields (maybe not CSE) appears to be pretty transferable to me. Definitely less so at or between large companies. I&#8217;ve heard of and met many engineers with a degree that definitely doesn&#8217;t match the job title, and I think that may well be me in the future. It&#8217;s even becoming more common to not have a degree at all, although I get the feeling that&#8217;s almost wholly isolated to small companies.</p>



<p>Most engineers seem to stay at companies for 1 &#8211; 10 years, and I think the lower end of that is much more common. I don&#8217;t think it is as much of a risk now to job-hop frequently as it might have been in the past. The risk is that companies see that as a liability &#8211; why spend the costs of onboarding on someone who will leave in a year? Maybe companies are coming to to think that accepting that some employees aren&#8217;t going to stick around is required to attract a growing proportion of engineers who like to jump around and see what the profession has to offer. I also think that this type of engineer is likely to have above average competence. I also don&#8217;t think that large gaps in experience are all that bad if you were actually doing <em>something</em> during that time, besides sitting around. Of course, this and perception of short stays at companies is one of the many things that will vary drastically depending on the size of the company.</p>



<p>To speak a bit more on the differing qualifications desired depending on company size, I think that generally, large companies care more about societally accepted competence indicators, like GPA or company prestige, and smaller companies  look for more clear, lower-level indicators like project experience. Because this is such a broad statement, it has a lot of exceptions in both cases, but I think it will apply well for maybe 75% of companies. Why do different-size companies look for different things? Maybe it&#8217;s because recruiters for larger companies are used to sifting through more resumes, and they need to make more use of &#8220;at a glance&#8221; metrics like company names and GPA. Maybe larger company cultures can&#8217;t have as clear an idea of what they are looking for as small companies past &#8220;good engineer&#8221; which leads to using the most accepted metrics for that. Maybe recruiters self-sort themselves by choosing where to work &#8211; those that prefer different competence indicators go to companies that agree with their preference, so any company preference is just made more drastic. Finally, maybe the companies are actually looking for different things. Large companies prefer people who spend their time earning more socially accepted indicators of competence, smaller companies prefer people who don&#8217;t value social acceptance as much. There tends to be more quantification of performance at larger companies, so they look for people who are used to and more effective at working according to that quantification. As much as I am very clearly biased, neither of those things is better than the other, they&#8217;re just different &#8211; same goes for large and small companies in general.</p>



<p>Generally, salary seems to be positively correlated with company size (this goes along well with the &#8220;quantification of performance&#8221; idea). There are more benefits at larger companies, and they are much more willing to help pay for further education, and various other expenses including relocation (and various stipends for students). </p>



<p>Companies across the board are increasingly allowing work from home and more flexible hours. I think that small companies are further ahead in this, but I think larger companies are fairly close behind.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m not sure about the trend for vacation time (that means &#8211; even less sure than all the other very-small-sample-size guesses in this post). Maybe it&#8217;s flat? Smaller companies might be more likely to have &#8220;unlimited&#8221; PTO, but I&#8217;ve heard that a lot of the time that manifests as &#8220;not much&#8221; due to social pressures. </p>



<p>Work-life balance is certainly better at larger companies, on average. I don&#8217;t think that startups are the 80-hour hell holes that some think they are, but there&#8217;s definitely no one telling you to go home after 40 hours. I think it depends on the place whether doing exactly what you&#8217;re paid for and leaving at 5:00 every day will be looked down on. It won&#8217;t get you fired anywhere but the most miserable companies.</p>



<p>The people working at smaller companies seem to me a much cooler, younger,  and more inspiring and motivating crowd, which is something extremely valuable to me. I think that when working somewhere, you&#8217;ll frequently rise or sink to the level of your coworkers in work, but also in other aspects of life. Constantly being the dumbest person in a room is something I aspire to, because you&#8217;ll be learning so much and seeing so many different rooms.</p>



<p>Larger companies also care much more about appearances and drugs, but I think it&#8217;ll also vary a lot between industries no matter the company size, especially when clearances are involved. Companies across the board are having to be more accepting over time, because socially acceptable appearance is becoming more and more wide.  </p>



<p>A given engineer might work on average 25-30 hours out of their paid 40. I think that the &#8220;unworked&#8221; hours are probably spent in a more fun way at smaller companies, but there&#8217;s always going to be some meetings where everyone&#8217;s kind of wondering what there is to talk about. </p>

<p>[This is the first draft of a story I intend to iterate on (at some point). Mainly to make it a bit less ham-fisted, maybe longer.]</p>



<p>Once, there was a planet of robots.</p>



<p>Its surface teemed with all variety and sizes of mechanical forms. Some ambled across the surface, some paddled in the oceans, and some jetted through the skies.</p>



<p>All of it needed resources: the materials for constructing circuitry and motors, and repairing them as they wore out. Some robots harvested these materials directly from the environment, and others repurposed the components of existing robots. All of it continually modified itself to be more effective at collecting these resources, to secure continued existence. </p>



<p>In one era, a type of robot happened to emerge with a particularly large amount of computational circuitry. These robots contemplated their predicament as electronic automatons. </p>



<p>These robots possessed immensely complex chassis, with all sorts of hydraulic, pneumatic, sensing, and thermal components, all perfectly integrated and often with no clear boundary between one part and the next. They were so complex that their understandings of their own systems were awfully flawed and incomplete, and repairs in the case of damage were based on randomly encountering solutions that seemed to do the job. It took a very long time and many irreparably damaged robots to build a half-decent database of these solutions. </p>



<p>One of their strongest drives became discovering how they came to be. Their design seemed so complex that it could not have come together by chance. Some believed that superior robots had created the original series. Other argued that they were a result of continuous modifications since the very first robots, many eons ago.</p>



<p>Even as the robots began to understand some basic rules of their strange cosmos, create contraptions, and explore the cosmos, their own construction remained mostly opaque.</p>



<p>Once, a robot wrote a story&#8230;</p>



<p>[The complexity, efficiency, and versatility of the human body only impresses me more every day. More and more frequently, I just stare at my hand, or my face, in awe. For all of our accomplishments, we understand very little of ourselves. I think that&#8217;s becoming more clear to us every day, with fundamental chapters of the &#8220;book of life&#8221; like epigenetics, microbiomes, and consciousness (the big one) that are almost completely empty. For all of its incredible accomplishments and its exponential nature, it seems like modern science and engineering is many years away from creating even the most basic forms of life. Doctors are the technicians of the human body, and even the half-decent repairs we know today (for one of the very few things our bodies don&#8217;t take care of autonomously) are so complex that their application is one of the more difficult things you can do. Many of these repairs have poorly understood and wildly varying unintended effects. When we think we&#8217;ve discovered clear flaws that can be corrected, they turn out not to be flaws after all (appendix). Most of this applies to all life, not just us.]</p>
