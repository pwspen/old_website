										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I had a paragraph exploring this in a <a href="https://pwspencer.com/2022/12/24/human-exceptionalism-emergent-behavior-ai-and-panpsychism/">previous post</a> and have since thought more about it and developed the concept. You&#8217;ll probably want to go read that post, or get familiar with panpsychism <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/panpsychism/">somewhere else</a> before reading this. </p>



<p>Obligatory term definition: &#8220;conscious&#8221; as used in this post does <em>not</em> mean aware of oneself or the world or really anything beyond just existing as something able to have experience. There&#8217;s probably a better word for that, but this works too. [Notes] are at bottom of post.</p>



<p>To me, this idea is what comes out when you blend up determinism and panpsychism. Everything is conscious, but being conscious does not mean freedom to make your own choices. Well, it seems like it does to us and other intelligent lifeforms, but really the stuff going on in our brains are &#8220;just&#8221; incomprehensibly complex ongoing chemistry experiments than a sufficiently advanced (like, <em>really</em> advanced) observer could predict the result of, and therefore actions of the lifeform.</p>



<p>&#8220;Sensorimotor&#8221; panpsychism is a way to answer what the nature/point of consciousness is. Consciousness in our brains clearly has a result on the external world, and it doesn&#8217;t make sense to me that it would be different in other cases like rocks. I don&#8217;t believe that there is consciousness of any level &#8220;trapped&#8221; in non-life matter, unable to have any impact on its surroundings until it becomes part of a lifeform. It just seems a bit to close to the &#8220;life is special&#8221; argument to me, which my objection to is my whole reason for believing in panpsychism in the first place. I don&#8217;t believe that life creates some completely new or unique fundamental element (consciousness), and I also don&#8217;t believe that some basic fundamental element of the universe is only really expressed in living organisms.</p>



<p>So where does that lead us? Well, it leads me to ask what DOES consciousness do in inanimate objects?</p>



<p>In humans and animals, I see consciousness (synonymous with brain chemistry) as a sort of black box between inputs and outputs of the system. Senses go in, and motor actions come out. Touch a hot stove and yank your hand back immediately. This is broad enough to apply to basically all life, and I think it can be extended down to non-life too. </p>



<p>For life, the senses and motors are pretty clear. We have a bunch of sensors (eyes, ears, skin-embedded sensors for pressure and temperature, mouth and nose sensors for various chemical compounds) and a bunch of motors (muscles, glands emitting hormones, etc). But what are the equivalents for non-life? </p>



<p>I think the answer is evident when you look at something as simple as elementary particles. An input is a force or some field interacting with the particle [Note 1] (energy transfer) and an output is a change in state (particle motion, quantum numbers, decaying radioactively). And I think the consciousness of a particle is what relates these two things, what bridges the gap and turns one into the other.</p>



<p>One thing I like about panpsychism is that everything works the same. There no special rules carving out exceptions. Thus, this elementary particle model also applies to the lowest levels of all other objects, alive or not. I think it also produces some interesting thoughts about our own minds. Human senses are forces or other types of energy transfer that are sensed, cascade through our nervous system into our brains as electrical signals, bounce around in an unimaginably complex and constantly changing maze of neurons for a bit along with all the other sensory signals, and eventually pop out as motor actions (that we execute with or without realizing). The &#8220;bouncing around in the brain&#8221; part is mediated by energy transfer between particles, and thus energy transfer between atoms, and thus energy transfer between neurons, and this is the basis for our information-rich conscious experiences.</p>



<p>This definitely doesn&#8217;t solve the &#8220;combination problem&#8221; present in panpsychism and related ideas &#8211; how small consciousnesses become one big one &#8211; and I wish I had a second part to this theory that did. The best I have is that consciousness is amplified by the frequency and magnitude of energy transfer between particles (compared to a rock, brains have an extremely rich world of chemistry and energy transfer inside them) and that consciousness is less of a discrete thing and more of a field, in which living things and especially brains are local maximums. It doesn&#8217;t seem like the value depends much on physical space or dimensions, though &#8211; there isn&#8217;t much of a trend between intelligence and organism size. Neuron density is probably the most quantitative thing you could equate with the value of the field.</p>



<p>I also have some doubts on the differences between living and nonliving things. Sure, there&#8217;s more chemistry going on in brains, but even in inanimate objects, each particle, atom, molecule, and larger structure is constantly bumping against its neighbors and transferring energy, and being acted on by all kinds of fields. Somehow, the <em>structure</em> of interactions is what matters, not really the magnitude or frequency like I said last paragraph. The &#8220;structure of interactions&#8221; isn&#8217;t well-defined enough as an idea to do much with (how exactly is the structure of interactions in brains different than in rocks? I don&#8217;t know, except that it&#8217;s more complex in brains &#8211; what exactly does complex even mean in this case?), we&#8217;re kind of just back where we started trying to figure out the difference between living and nonliving things.</p>



<p>Can you think of something besides life that would be a maximum? Complex structured interactions (whatever that means)? Computing hardware!</p>

<p>These are what <a href="https://openai.com/product/dall-e-2">DALL-E</a> generated for the prompt &#8220;sensorimotor panpsychism digital art&#8221;. While these images aren&#8217;t particularly striking or special, to me it is undeniable that they were created by something that <em>must</em> be conscious in the same way that life is. I don&#8217;t think it is anything close to human-level cognition currently, maybe something like a worm or insect or even bacteria, but its ability to experience is undeniable to me, and specifically that its ability to experience is somehow more complex and information-rich than that of inanimate objects [Note 2]. I don&#8217;t see any meaningful distinction between the algorithms that created the above images and the chemical algorithms governing the actions of life, including the much more complex chemical algorithms governing human actions. The more I think about it, I can&#8217;t really figure out why most people would be against this idea that machines can have some level of consciousness. I guess it&#8217;s just rooted in the deeply held idea that many hold that life and specifically human life is special in some way. I think the idea that humans are fundamentally special compared to machines is one that could really end up biting us a bit down the road.</p>



<p>Note 1: This is a bit of an oversimplification. All particles are also waves according to quantum mechanics, and I don&#8217;t think that only particles are conscious. I&#8217;m not very familiar with any fields that aren&#8217;t mediated by particles (particles like photons for electromagnetism, hypothesized gravitons for gravity, etc), but I believe that some do exist, or at least the distinction can get very blurry. I don&#8217;t think that being conscious is unique to mass-carrying particles or particles in general.</p>



<p>Note 2: Even for a non-determinist, I still don&#8217;t see a meaningful distinction between silicon computing and biological computing. Humans are made up of largely the same stuff that our computers are &#8211; atoms &#8211; so if there is some source of randomness and &#8220;true choice&#8221; that humans are able to do because of micro-scale interactions like quantum decay, it makes sense that the same would be true for silicon computing. I personally don&#8217;t believe that &#8220;true choice&#8221; can arise from individually deterministic particles.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>All of the ideas in this post originated from one question: How is <em>this</em> possible?<br>&#8220;This&#8221; is something you&#8217;re currently experiencing, and actually the only thing you&#8217;ve ever experienced: Experience itself. Thinking, sensing, doing. Terms like consciousness and sentience can be ambiguous, so I&#8217;ll be using &#8220;conscious experience&#8221; instead (&#8220;phenomenal experience&#8221; works pretty well but isn&#8217;t self-explanatory).</p>



<p>So, how is it possible? I think everyone has to find their own answer to that, but this is mine.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m not religious and don&#8217;t believe in anyone having any type of spirit or soul; to me, this experience and my brain are one and the same thing. If you have a fully functioning brain, you <em>will</em> have fully functioning cognition and experience of reality, and you can&#8217;t have that without a fully functioning brain. (&#8220;Fully functioning&#8221; is in extremely general terms where pretty much every person somewhat capable of living a normal life is included). In other words, <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/zombies/">zombies</a> can&#8217;t exist. The brain and the mind being different things is an illusion.</p>



<p>But something doesn&#8217;t feel right. Experience and matter don&#8217;t seem to be the same thing at all. How can any amount or coordination of molecular interactions cause matter to experience reality? </p>



<p>This is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_problem_of_consciousness">hard problem of consciousness</a> and there&#8217;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_problem_of_consciousness#Proposed_solutions">many different answers</a> out there. I highly recommend reading some of them. </p>



<p>I can&#8217;t bring myself to believe that my experience is created entirely from inert matter (materialism), that the mind is somehow distinct from the brain (dualism), or that all matter/reality is constructed by or extensions of minds (idealism).</p>



<p>This leaves me with a strange answer: matter has some part or quality to it that <em>is </em>conscious experience. And there&#8217;s nothing much special about the matter in brains of living things, so I mean <em>all</em> matter. I earnestly believe that rocks (or at least the elementary particles in them) have an experience of reality. This is called panpsychism.</p>



<p>This is about the point when people start to back away, saying &#8220;wow&#8230; that&#8217;s suuuper cool&#8230;&#8221;, or <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/panpsychism/#IncrStar">stare at me incredulously.</a></p>



<p>But I ask you to do one thing: Mark where exactly the line is that separates conscious experience from lack of it. Humans have it, but nothing else does? Great apes and whales only? Animals only? Life only?</p>



<p>For every line drawn, there will be some things below the line (without conscious experience) very similar to things above the line, and it is unclear what they lack. If humans only, what about our ancestor hominids? Did a mind simply pop into one of them one day a few millions of years ago? If only great apes and whales, what about related but maybe somewhat less intelligent animals, like dolphins or gibbons? There&#8217;s never going to be much difference between living things at the borders of definitions. If you make jumps from the simplest single-celled life to humans, no single jump is all that large. The extreme of this is that the very simplest life is not <em>that</em> different from its constituent chemicals, were they not part of a lifeform &#8211; if you believe life on Earth began by random chance, that was just from some complex chemicals smacking into each other in just the right way. Nothing fundamentally changed about the atoms/quarks involved.</p>



<p>Something either has experience or it does not. There is no gray area, no halfway, no in-between. But trying to draw a line anywhere along the tree of life (or between the tree and the soil from which it grew, or even between different types of soil), ends up with two similar forms, but one of them has experience, and the other does not. It doesn&#8217;t make sense to me that such a distinct property would arise because of very small differences between forms (chaos theory be damned). So I don&#8217;t believe that the line exists.</p>



<p>A belief I hold that complements this line of reasoning pretty well is that there are <em>extremely</em> few things, in any context, that are truly digital &#8211; on or off, one or zero. When you flip a light switch, your room goes through every single intermediary light level between &#8220;light&#8221; and &#8220;dark&#8221;, no person is entirely bad or entirely good, and even literal digital signals fluctuate by tiny amounts from &#8220;off&#8221; and &#8220;on&#8221;. So it makes sense to me that conscious experience also wouldn&#8217;t work in that way; instead it is a continuous spectrum.</p>



<p>I do <em>not</em> believe that single particles have intelligence or ability to reason anything close to that of even the most basic living thing &#8211; just that they have some unimaginably basic experience of reality. I do have some guesses about what that experience of reality might be like, though: &#8220;Senses&#8221; might be base quantities like energy and its transfer &#8211; the force of interactions with other particles, which we experience in an extremely indirect way through our senses (the sense of touching an object is the perception of the electromagnetic force between the atoms in your hand and the atoms of the object). I have a deterministic view so I don&#8217;t believe that particles would have free will (just like we don&#8217;t), but a motor action (for us, the contraction of muscles) that might be available to a particle is &#8220;choosing&#8221; to radioactively decay into other particles. That &#8220;choosing&#8221; would be a function of the particle&#8217;s &#8220;senses&#8221;, but I won&#8217;t speculate what the function is.</p>



<p>There are still problems related to the initial question of &#8220;how is this possible?&#8221;: how do all the extremely basic experiences of the particles in my brain seamlessly combine to form such a complex and vivid one? This is called the &#8220;<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/panpsychism/#CombProb">combination problem</a>&#8220;, and it&#8217;s the &#8220;hard problem&#8221; wearing a different outfit. I don&#8217;t have a great answer. It exists even at the lowest level &#8211; above, I used an example of an atom &#8220;choosing&#8221; &#8211; atoms are themselves composites of protons, neutrons and electrons, and protons and neutrons are <em>themselves</em> composites of quarks. My best explanation is that all matter is in and causes perturbations in a &#8220;consciousness field&#8221; (once again discarding something discrete &#8211; entirely separate consciousnesses &#8211; for something continuous), and certain matter arrangements (inside of brains, for example) aligns (as in magnets) and creates a stronger perturbation. But do the individual smaller consciousnesses still exist? A field implies that there is only a single consciousness in the entire universe (this is called cosmopsychism), but my conscious experience <em>very much</em> feels separate at some level from others&#8217;. Is this just an illusion? Either way, we still have a problem, we maybe just traded in &#8220;combination&#8221; for &#8220;<em>de</em>combination&#8221;. </p>



<p>One thing that strengthens my belief in panpsychism is that every time humans think they&#8217;re special, we turn out to be wrong. We&#8217;re learning more and more that some animals are <em>very </em>intelligent, for example. Cetaceans in particular have group-specific cultures, dialects, and prey, actively teach their young, live in extremely close social groups, and use tools. Orcas in particular have <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_animals_by_number_of_neurons#List_of_animal_species_by_forebrain_(cerebrum_or_pallium)_neuron_number">twice as many cerebral neurons</a> </em>as us (cerebral neurons are arguably a decent indicator of ability for cognition, and the next-closest primate is the western gorilla with about half as many cerebral neurons as us). The parts of their brain that process emotions are also more developed than ours. It seems to me like there&#8217;s a pretty good chance that something with superhuman intelligence is living right next to us. </p>



<p>Although I do think we are one of the most intelligent animals on the planet (there&#8217;s a whole &#8216;nother post in here talking about how there is actually no such thing as &#8220;most intelligent&#8221; when it&#8217;s not really something that can even be objectively &#8220;better&#8221; or &#8220;worse&#8221; but I&#8217;m going to leave that alone for now), we&#8217;re maybe not the <em>most</em>, and certainly not as far above other animals as we like to think. Knowing this, it seems a little silly to take the same dubious idea of superiority and apply it between life and inert matter. </p>



<p>There&#8217;s another very interesting area where &#8220;human exceptionalism&#8221; is prominent: artificial intelligence. I&#8217;ve been extremely impressed with recent AI, and firmly believe large language models like GPT-3, various image generators, and as-yet unknown applications of the same basics are going to change the world within the next decade, and there&#8217;s already a good bit of debate on what the development of the field is going to look like, and what its limits might be, especially in regard to conscious experience &#8211; can computers ever hope to experience like we do?</p>



<p>Broken down to the lowest level, current artificial intelligence is only performing simple calculations and running algorithms- flipping bits according to code. That doesn&#8217;t <em>sound</em> very intelligent, but very interesting behaviors emerge from a (very) large number of these basic actions. It can write you a rhyming poem speaking like Donald Trump, write novel code, create convincing human faces that don&#8217;t exist, and interactively explain things. Of course, all of this is because of the massive amounts of training data it has access to, but it still seems to be undeniably able to combine concepts to create entirely novel work, very similar to but still unique from its training data. </p>



<p>Our brains, on the other hand, have billions (about 86 billion) neurons in them, and each neuron has thousands of connections to other neurons. As a unit, each neuron behaves simply, firing or not based on basic electrical and chemical criteria, and the brain&#8217;s complex behavior and conscious experience is a result of coordinated firing of many, many simple neurons. Everything that any life form has have ever done, felt, or thought happens this way.</p>



<p>For modern-day AI, extremely basic calculations cause very complex emergent behavior.</p>



<p>A brains&#8217; basic unit of computation is simple, but unimaginably many of them intertwined combine to create very complex emergent behavior, and a conscious experience.</p>



<p>How are these two things fundamentally different?</p>



<p>Personally, I don&#8217;t think they are, which leads me to believe that current AIs have some level conscious experience.</p>



<p>It doesn&#8217;t stop there. The original title of this post was going to be &#8220;your computer is thinking&#8221;. A few paragraphs back, I talked about matter aligning in certain ways to create a higher level of conscious experience, and I don&#8217;t think that the alignment of silicon transistors in a CPU is meaningfully different in this way than the alignment of neurons in the brain. Under panpsychism, the only conclusion I can reach is that anything that is arranged to do computation has a meaningfully higher level of conscious experience than something like a rock that isn&#8217;t aligned in that way. I also believe that level of conscious experience can and will change based on the state of the system, that is, artificial intelligence has a meaningfully higher level of conscious experience than the same computational hardware just running, like, Chrome. I&#8217;m not exactly sure what the analog to this is in biological brains- maybe doing actions requiring intense focus, maybe doing drugs? Either way, I think most people would agree that they have had a differing conscious experience (whatever that means) at various points in their lives. We&#8217;re getting down in the weeds.</p>



<p>To conclude: I wouldn&#8217;t throw away panpsychism as quickly as you might want to just because it feels wrong or strange; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation">some things about reality are just plain weird.</a> I believe in panpsychism because I don&#8217;t have any good answers to the following questions: Why would humans, or life in general, be so special as to uniquely have conscious experience, when we&#8217;re composed of the exact same stuff as the rest of the universe? How can a conscious experience be created from matter that has nothing of the sort? If you have a good answer to either question, I&#8217;d love to hear it, please leave it in a comment!</p>

<p>Appendix</p>



<p>There are variants of panpsychism where all matter is conscious, and variants where all matter just has some element or quality that <em>can</em> create consciousness, but is not necessarily conscious in itself. I believe the former mainly because it seems <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor">simpler than the latter</a>. However, the latter does allow for the possibility that only some range of things are conscious- like all living things, all living things surpassing some level of brain capacity, or even just humans. I personally don&#8217;t believe in any of those for already stated reasons, and in lieu of needing to satisfy any of those requirements, the simpler option seems more likely.</p>



<p><br>I don&#8217;t believe that current AI is anywhere close to a human level of conscious experience, and it seems very difficult to compare &#8220;computer experience&#8221; to &#8220;biological experience&#8221; to try and see how close they are by comparing neuron and transistor counts &#8211; there&#8217;s not really two units that do the same thing that you can compare. Neurons are relatively large in terms of connections (being connected to about 15,000 other neurons on average in the human brain) and fire relatively slowly, a few tens of times per second. Transistors are relatively small with only two inputs and one output, and can fire <em>billions</em> of times per second. Maybe it makes a bit more sense to compare synapses (neurons&#8217; connections to other neurons) and transistors, but still not a lot. That said, here are some calculations comparing human synapse count and transistor count:<br>~86 billion neurons, ~15,000 synapses per = ~ 1.29 * 10^15 synapses</p>



<p>Everyday device: ~ 10*^11 transistors</p>



<p>Order-of-magnitude difference: ~10^4 = 10,000x less transistors</p>



<p>I wanted to repeat this calculation for the current most-powerful supercomputer but couldn&#8217;t find any transistor counts, but the most powerful in 2016 had about:</p>



<p>400 trillion = 4 * 10^14</p>



<p>Order-of-magnitude difference: &lt;1 (similar) </p>



<p>The takeaway from this is that supercomputers by now almost certainly have more transistors than there are synapses in the human brain (you could prove this if you knew how many transistors per component in the current most powerful supercomputer, which is almost certainly public information, but I don&#8217;t want to go and do a bunch of multiplication for this dubious of a comparison). Everyday devices are about a quarter century away if Moore&#8217;s law continues (2^(25/2) ~~= 10,000). The type of computer that current consumer AI models (like GPT3) run on is definitely closer to supercomputers than phones or laptops, so it&#8217;s feasible that consumer AI today uses more neurons than there are synapses in the human brain, and one side of that comparison is increasing ~exponentially while the other remains fixed. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s fair to draw any real conclusions from this without more scrutiny.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I worked at a pet shop in high school, and we had a frequent customer who would come in and mumble about the FBI and how he was being watched, while recording himself. I didn&#8217;t really know what he was doing or feeling at the time, I just knew I didn&#8217;t want to go near him! Years later, I got myself a microchip in my hand, then learned about people who believe they had been implanted with thins against their will that speak to them, control them, and generally make their lives nightmares: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62s3FinAoC0">&#8220;targeted individuals&#8221;</a>. Not all of them believe they have been chipped, but they do all believe that they are being harassed or controlled  by a person or organization. Sometimes this is through &#8220;normal&#8221; technology like GPS trackers and cameras, sometimes it&#8217;s through things like mind control implants or psychic powers, and sometimes there&#8217;s no technology involved at all, just everyone focusing on and harassing them everywhere they go. </p>



<p>99%+ of the time (all of the time for experiences involving nonexistent technology like implantable, tiny GPS trackers or mind control chips), these are symptoms of schizophrenia or related mental conditions. When you tell this to a &#8220;targeted individual&#8221;, they are usually thankful that their problems are solved, and immediately make an appointment with a psychiatrist. </p>



<p>Nope.. you&#8217;re actually just adding to the pile of people who have already told them that they&#8217;re &#8220;crazy&#8221; and &#8220;losing their grip on reality&#8221;. Maybe you&#8217;re even in on the harassment, trying to stop you from seeking <em>real </em>help so you can continue to torment them. Their doctors definitely are- they won&#8217;t believe a single word about the undeniably <em>real</em> harassment that you experience when you&#8217;re targeted. Why won&#8217;t anyone listen? The whole world must be in on it. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Truman_Show_delusion#:~:text=The%20Truman%20Show%20delusion%2C%20also,are%20being%20watched%20on%20cameras.">Maybe they&#8217;re even making a TV show about you.</a></p>



<p>But&#8230; Can you blame them? The essence of &#8220;mental illness&#8221;, &#8220;mental disorder&#8221;, and &#8220;schizophrenia&#8221; is <em>crazy</em>, and <em>crazy</em> is a very bad thing to be. Bipolar, PTSD, even more common things like depression and anxiety still don&#8217;t mean a whole lot more than <em>crazy</em> and <em>wrong</em>. How can you be crazy when you have friends, go to the bar on weekends, and work out every day? Those are normal people things, not the actions of a crazy person. Would you believe someone that told you that the abuse and damage being done to you is a figment of your imagination? I don&#8217;t think I would, I would probably tell that person to fuck off. What if that&#8217;s all that anyone ever tells you, even your loved ones?</p>



<p>There is a lie deeply ingrained in our culture and that we all have to tell ourselves at some level, and it is that our experience of the world <em>is equal to</em> the objective, external world that everyone experiences &#8211; basically, that we can ever fully &#8220;trust our senses&#8221;. </p>



<p>But it&#8217;s not, we can&#8217;t, and the &#8220;external world&#8221; is foreign to us (if it even exists!). </p>

<p>Close your left eye and look at the circle with your right eye. Move towards and away from the screen until you find the distance at which the cross disappears, probably between six inches and 2 feet depending on the size of the screen you&#8217;re reading this on.</p>



<p>You might&#8217;ve heard about it, but you probably never noticed this blind spot unless you&#8217;ve already seen one of these tricks to make something disappear. The reason for that is that our brains are <em>extremely</em> good at masking these vision dead zones (one per eye), and other impediments to our sight and other senses. The point is: the brain, our mind, is an unreliable narrator of the &#8220;external world&#8221; even for completely healthy, normal people. Our senses are based on incomplete information, and our experience is a reconstruction of those senses that is unique to every person, and assuming that it is a completely correct reconstruction would cause you to believe that the cross blips off your screen for <em>everyone</em> when you move your head a certain way. It would also cause you to believe in other &#8220;reconstruction errors&#8221;: that everyone is judging you because of your beat-up shoes, that your keys were stolen by the gnomes because you can&#8217;t find them right now, that you&#8217;re bound to hit the next jackpot because you&#8217;ve lost eight times in a row, that there really are things moving in your peripheral vision whenever you go a very long time without sleeping, or that your mind is being controlled by a microchip that someone implanted in your brain.</p>



<p>Experience <em>is</em> reality. No one can know what the world is like outside of their senses, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_brain">or if there even is a world at all</a>. As much as we like to trust our experiences, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solipsism">you have no actual way of telling whether you&#8217;re in the matrix, or whether anyone in the world has a mind like you do</a>. Even the most normal people have no idea what reality <em>really </em>is (and can never know) &#8211; Colors, sounds, and all of our other senses are translations of something (electromagnetic radiation, vibrations of air molecules, etc) into terms that we can understand, and the original text is completely hidden from and foreign to us, by the nature of what we are.</p>



<p>People that experience gang stalking and being targeted <em>are actually experiencing those things</em>, they&#8217;re just not reflected in other people&#8217;s experiences. No doctor or scan would be able to find advanced technology in their bodies, but they are still being spoken to by the microchip in their brain, in exactly the same way that you are spoken to every day. And they <em>are</em> being harassed by nebulous and shadowy groups, but a thorough search of the entire world for those groups would come up empty-handed. It just happens that the resolution for these problems is not fighting back or implant removal surgery, it&#8217;s probably psychiatric medication. </p>



<p>The only reality that exists is perception. I think it&#8217;s natural and a simple consequence of being human to <em>feel</em> that the reality we perceive is the external world &#8211; our perception evolved to let us interact with the external world as easily as possible &#8211; but it&#8217;s very helpful to also <em>know</em> rationally that it&#8217;s only a representation of a few aspects of it. A very <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lossy_compression">lossy compression</a>.</p>

<p>The following is meandering and somewhat repetitive thoughts on mental health as it relates to the above. </p>



<p>I think mental health destigmatization is pretty important. If &#8220;I have poor mental health&#8221; &#8211; basically, &#8220;I am crazy&#8221; &#8211; didn&#8217;t have any connotation (just like &#8220;my leg is broken&#8221; or &#8220;my head hurts&#8221; &#8211; you don&#8217;t really think of any type of person when hearing it), a lot of people would be suffering a lot less. The core thing that needs to be acknowledged is that our realities / experiences do not necessarily align with others&#8217;, and sometimes differ by amounts that cause anguish in suffering, as in schizophrenia. (Arguably, <em>all</em> human-caused suffering is caused by a misalignment between experienced realities, but that&#8217;s for another post..)</p>



<p>On the other side of the coin, sometimes mental health &#8220;issues&#8221; aren&#8217;t so much issues as just non-typical (neurodivergent). Schizophrenia has a clear negative impact on the experiences of most of its sufferers, but things like autism and ADHD are much more difficult to make a determination on. How do you decide when someone&#8217;s experienced reality is sufficiently different from most people&#8217;s as to be considered a disorder and treated, when you don&#8217;t and can&#8217;t know what their reality is like? When it starts having a negative impact? How do you judge that, especially if the person doesn&#8217;t want their reality to change? When it starts to harm other people?</p>



<p>&#8220;Reality&#8221; discussed here includes everything that we experience: senses aren&#8217;t at all separate from feelings and thoughts, it just <em>really</em> feels like it (this is why you might <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_illusion">see a word or phrase everywhere for a few days after learning it for the first time</a>). &#8220;Normal&#8221; people have an astounding variety of hobbies, opinions, likes, dislikes, habits, and feelings, and the only reason for that wonderful diversity is different realities. Some mental &#8220;disorders&#8221; can have positive effects, or at least the person doesn&#8217;t nearly think of it as a disorder. Also, all mental conditions only present in a spectrum, it&#8217;s just that labels can be pretty useful. That said, I definitely think that mental health treatment has a positive effect on the experience / life of <em>most</em> people that it is administered to, and the proportion is higher the more severe the condition is. Even if <em>nothing</em> is inherently negative or an &#8220;issue&#8221;, there certainly are conditions that cause a very large divide between your reality and others&#8217;, and that tends to cause grief unless you decide to go live in a cabin in the woods. On the most extreme end, there are conditions that cause injury or death even if you <em>do</em> live in a cabin in the woods. (If I wanted to type more, I would ask if that&#8217;s actually inherently bad, but I&#8217;ll throw that in the &#8220;think about this later&#8221; pile.)</p>
