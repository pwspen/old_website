										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I had a paragraph exploring this in a <a href="https://pwspencer.com/2022/12/24/human-exceptionalism-emergent-behavior-ai-and-panpsychism/">previous post</a> and have since thought more about it and developed the concept. You&#8217;ll probably want to go read that post, or get familiar with panpsychism <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/panpsychism/">somewhere else</a> before reading this. </p>



<p>Obligatory term definition: &#8220;conscious&#8221; as used in this post does <em>not</em> mean aware of oneself or the world or really anything beyond just existing as something able to have experience. There&#8217;s probably a better word for that, but this works too. [Notes] are at bottom of post.</p>



<p>To me, this idea is what comes out when you blend up determinism and panpsychism. Everything is conscious, but being conscious does not mean freedom to make your own choices. Well, it seems like it does to us and other intelligent lifeforms, but really the stuff going on in our brains are &#8220;just&#8221; incomprehensibly complex ongoing chemistry experiments than a sufficiently advanced (like, <em>really</em> advanced) observer could predict the result of, and therefore actions of the lifeform.</p>



<p>&#8220;Sensorimotor&#8221; panpsychism is a way to answer what the nature/point of consciousness is. Consciousness in our brains clearly has a result on the external world, and it doesn&#8217;t make sense to me that it would be different in other cases like rocks. I don&#8217;t believe that there is consciousness of any level &#8220;trapped&#8221; in non-life matter, unable to have any impact on its surroundings until it becomes part of a lifeform. It just seems a bit to close to the &#8220;life is special&#8221; argument to me, which my objection to is my whole reason for believing in panpsychism in the first place. I don&#8217;t believe that life creates some completely new or unique fundamental element (consciousness), and I also don&#8217;t believe that some basic fundamental element of the universe is only really expressed in living organisms.</p>



<p>So where does that lead us? Well, it leads me to ask what DOES consciousness do in inanimate objects?</p>



<p>In humans and animals, I see consciousness (synonymous with brain chemistry) as a sort of black box between inputs and outputs of the system. Senses go in, and motor actions come out. Touch a hot stove and yank your hand back immediately. This is broad enough to apply to basically all life, and I think it can be extended down to non-life too. </p>



<p>For life, the senses and motors are pretty clear. We have a bunch of sensors (eyes, ears, skin-embedded sensors for pressure and temperature, mouth and nose sensors for various chemical compounds) and a bunch of motors (muscles, glands emitting hormones, etc). But what are the equivalents for non-life? </p>



<p>I think the answer is evident when you look at something as simple as elementary particles. An input is a force or some field interacting with the particle [Note 1] (energy transfer) and an output is a change in state (particle motion, quantum numbers, decaying radioactively). And I think the consciousness of a particle is what relates these two things, what bridges the gap and turns one into the other.</p>



<p>One thing I like about panpsychism is that everything works the same. There no special rules carving out exceptions. Thus, this elementary particle model also applies to the lowest levels of all other objects, alive or not. I think it also produces some interesting thoughts about our own minds. Human senses are forces or other types of energy transfer that are sensed, cascade through our nervous system into our brains as electrical signals, bounce around in an unimaginably complex and constantly changing maze of neurons for a bit along with all the other sensory signals, and eventually pop out as motor actions (that we execute with or without realizing). The &#8220;bouncing around in the brain&#8221; part is mediated by energy transfer between particles, and thus energy transfer between atoms, and thus energy transfer between neurons, and this is the basis for our information-rich conscious experiences.</p>



<p>This definitely doesn&#8217;t solve the &#8220;combination problem&#8221; present in panpsychism and related ideas &#8211; how small consciousnesses become one big one &#8211; and I wish I had a second part to this theory that did. The best I have is that consciousness is amplified by the frequency and magnitude of energy transfer between particles (compared to a rock, brains have an extremely rich world of chemistry and energy transfer inside them) and that consciousness is less of a discrete thing and more of a field, in which living things and especially brains are local maximums. It doesn&#8217;t seem like the value depends much on physical space or dimensions, though &#8211; there isn&#8217;t much of a trend between intelligence and organism size. Neuron density is probably the most quantitative thing you could equate with the value of the field.</p>



<p>I also have some doubts on the differences between living and nonliving things. Sure, there&#8217;s more chemistry going on in brains, but even in inanimate objects, each particle, atom, molecule, and larger structure is constantly bumping against its neighbors and transferring energy, and being acted on by all kinds of fields. Somehow, the <em>structure</em> of interactions is what matters, not really the magnitude or frequency like I said last paragraph. The &#8220;structure of interactions&#8221; isn&#8217;t well-defined enough as an idea to do much with (how exactly is the structure of interactions in brains different than in rocks? I don&#8217;t know, except that it&#8217;s more complex in brains &#8211; what exactly does complex even mean in this case?), we&#8217;re kind of just back where we started trying to figure out the difference between living and nonliving things.</p>



<p>Can you think of something besides life that would be a maximum? Complex structured interactions (whatever that means)? Computing hardware!</p>

<p>These are what <a href="https://openai.com/product/dall-e-2">DALL-E</a> generated for the prompt &#8220;sensorimotor panpsychism digital art&#8221;. While these images aren&#8217;t particularly striking or special, to me it is undeniable that they were created by something that <em>must</em> be conscious in the same way that life is. I don&#8217;t think it is anything close to human-level cognition currently, maybe something like a worm or insect or even bacteria, but its ability to experience is undeniable to me, and specifically that its ability to experience is somehow more complex and information-rich than that of inanimate objects [Note 2]. I don&#8217;t see any meaningful distinction between the algorithms that created the above images and the chemical algorithms governing the actions of life, including the much more complex chemical algorithms governing human actions. The more I think about it, I can&#8217;t really figure out why most people would be against this idea that machines can have some level of consciousness. I guess it&#8217;s just rooted in the deeply held idea that many hold that life and specifically human life is special in some way. I think the idea that humans are fundamentally special compared to machines is one that could really end up biting us a bit down the road.</p>



<p>Note 1: This is a bit of an oversimplification. All particles are also waves according to quantum mechanics, and I don&#8217;t think that only particles are conscious. I&#8217;m not very familiar with any fields that aren&#8217;t mediated by particles (particles like photons for electromagnetism, hypothesized gravitons for gravity, etc), but I believe that some do exist, or at least the distinction can get very blurry. I don&#8217;t think that being conscious is unique to mass-carrying particles or particles in general.</p>



<p>Note 2: Even for a non-determinist, I still don&#8217;t see a meaningful distinction between silicon computing and biological computing. Humans are made up of largely the same stuff that our computers are &#8211; atoms &#8211; so if there is some source of randomness and &#8220;true choice&#8221; that humans are able to do because of micro-scale interactions like quantum decay, it makes sense that the same would be true for silicon computing. I personally don&#8217;t believe that &#8220;true choice&#8221; can arise from individually deterministic particles.</p>

<p>Top: Coin cell batteries going through electrical testing on galvanostat<br>Bottom: Black phosphorus anodes ready for battery assembly</p>



<p>Between Feb &#8211; May 2021, during my internship at my university&#8217;s renewable energy lab, I managed a research project investigating performance of sodium and black phosphorus as battery electrode materials. I was in charge of all steps of the process, from material and component preparation (like the electrodes above), to battery assembly, to electrical testing to determine voltage, capacity, and cyclability properties among others, to examining battery electrodes with Raman and X-ray diffraction spectroscopy, and then using that spectroscopy data to make changes to material prep and battery assembly in order to improve electrical properties. </p>



<p>I presented my progress weekly to one of the lab&#8217;s professors and communicated constantly with other researchers for advice and assistance. I also frequently read literature published on similar battery chemistries to find new ways to improve electrical performance.</p>



<p>I prepared the battery anodes by mixing black phosphorus with additives in specific ratios, then pressed the resultant layered material onto a wire mesh substrate (pictured above). These phosphorus anodes were dried for a day, and then moved into an argon glovebox, along with the other battery components for battery assembly. In the glovebox, I made the sodium metal cathode and assembled the batteries, then removed them from the glovebox and hooked them up for electrical testing, which could take a few days. After they were depleted to a certain voltage or had been cycled between two voltages a certain number of times, I identified specific cells which had the potential to produce interesting spectroscopy results and then prepared them for examination and used Raman or XrD spectroscopy machines and associated software to examine material properties &#8211; specifically, the degree of intercalation of sodium ions into the black phosphorus anode, which is associated with cyclability / reusability.</p>



<p>In the end, I determined that sodium-BP battery chemistry had a relatively low degree of cyclability / reusability (specifically, the sodium ions were too large and ripped apart the layered anode as they entered and exited it, which led to a much lower anode charge capacity over just a few charge-discharge cycles). If they can ever be made commercially feasible, sodium ion batteries will be very interesting because they stand a chance at replacing lithium in some applications (those where energy density and current capacity are not concerns, like renewable energy storage). Lithium is rare, a conflict mineral, and quickly running out / becoming more expensive to extract, while sodium is extremely plentiful everywhere you look, especially the ocean. I&#8217;m very happy to have played a tiny part in moving the world in a more renewable direction.</p>

<p>Coin cell battery that I assembled, ruptured due to bad assembly. For the first few weeks I worked on this project, around half the batteries ruptured like this partway through testing until I figured out the mistake I was making in the assembly process and fixed it.</p>

<p>From January &#8211; June 2022, I captained my rocket team of ~30 people. My time as captain culminated in our competing in Spaceport America Cup 2022 in New Mexico, where we finished in the top third of teams.</p>



<p>Pictured above is our other launch of the season, a test launch in Illinois about a month before the competition. I&#8217;m in the center.</p>



<p>As captain, I managed the team&#8217;s schedule and delegated tasks to team leads to ensure readiness for the test flight and competition. I acted as a systems engineer to ensure proper integration and cooperation between teams. I communicated with competition officials before and during the competition to submit various deliverables on time and keep the rest of the team informed. I also assembled our commercial rocket motors (CTI N5600) for both our test and competition launches. This season was especially difficult because most of our team, even some of the team leads, did not have any hands-on experience as a result of COVID and an associated dip in team activity and membership.</p>

<p>This role taught me a lot about conflict resolution and communication. The team had frequent internal conflicts (as college teams are wont to do), and I personally intervened in/mediated a few, especially those where safety was involved. I held design reviews, both for individual subteams and for the entire competition rocket. I reached out to academic, corporate, and individual donors and managed to raise more than $50k total for the team. </p>

<p>Our competition was disastrous, partly due to lacking team readiness and partly due to circumstances (the rental car I was driving broke down, another hit a deer; our trailer&#8217;s tires had to be replaced halfway to competition; extremely unlikely series of storms; all manner of rocket malfunctions). Through all of this, I did my best to keep the team strong and optimistic, and we ended up having a picture-perfect launch. Our recovery didn&#8217;t go as well and we had to leave part of our rocket in the desert. This part was later found and shipped back to us, thanks to calculations I did regarding the location of our missing rocket section which let hiker volunteers find it.</p>

<p>After the competition, and two of the most stressful weeks of my life, I implemented changes for the following season to hopefully eliminate all of the problems we encountered, including creating a designated systems engineer role to increase communication between subteams. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LVOFDgli1X0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;start=17726&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox"></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>This experience taught me how to lead a large team effectively, even under a state of extreme and prolonged stress for everyone involved. While it was a huge challenge, I rose to it and wouldn&#8217;t give up the experience for anything. I am a massively better leader because of the all the adversity that we faced and beat as a team.</p>

<p>Top: P&amp;ID for our planned kerolox, 1000lbf, 700psi Pc, N2 pressed engine. <a href="https://patrickwspencer7973e68df9.files.wordpress.com/2023/02/image-73.png">Link to full-sized image</a><br>Middle 1: Control panel built in LabVIEW for the same feed system. <br>Middle 2: Combustion chamber for previously (no longer) planned 1000lbf ethanol/nitrous engine.<br>Bottom: Most of the team&#8217;s hardware, which was initially built for above engine.</p>



<p>I have been the lead of my rocket team&#8217;s propulsion subteam since September 2020. My subteam usually had between 5 and 10 members. I inherited an ethanol/nitrous engine. We decided to switch to kerosene/LOX in early 2022 because of more member and advisor experience with LOX than nitrous, kerolox being more industry-applicable, and still being able to use most of our existing hardware after switching.</p>



<p>As propulsion lead, I taught all parts of propulsion design to team members, including fluid systems, combustion, cooling, component selection, P&amp;ID design, and various aspects of safety. I communicated frequently with our team&#8217;s liquid propulsion advisor and various university contacts including safety professionals and university leadership (for funding). I oversaw the creation of an entirely new feed system P&amp;ID (pictured above), lead the team through a propellant switch, and largely decided the direction of the team.</p>



<p>We have yet to hot-fire anything, but we have less of a &#8220;paper engine&#8221; than many propulsion teams. We have a mostly completed test stand (red weldment pictured above) and already have most of the components in the above P&amp;ID in hand. However, we&#8217;ve also been beset by funding and bureaucratic issues, as well as the obvious COVID, otherwise we would have been able to hot-fire years ago (our liquids team was started around 2018, a year before I joined the team). To get past these issues, we decided in January 2023 to focus on a ~10lb thrust engine to be used in the future as an igniter for our main engine, to raise funds, build member experience, and showcase safe rocket engine operation. We are also working on a custom engine simulation program capable of simulating regen cooling, and with an iterative solver to determine optimal design conditions (wall thicknesses, cooling channel geometry, size, and number) for a given variable (like coolant temperature at exit from cooling channel).</p>



<p>Almost all of the skills I possess, technical and communicative, were first developed on the propulsion team. Through my time as a member and lead, I&#8217;ve learned a truly indescribable amount about liquid rocket engines and everything surrounding them (DAQ/control systems, fluid systems, test stands, safety), and just as much about the arts of leadership, effective task delegation, member mentorship, and good ol&#8217; clear, concise communication.</p>

<p>This is a vehicle that 2 friends and I have been working on since August 2022. It is a VTVL rocket propelled by pressurized CO2, weighs about 30lb empty and 60lb full of propellant, and is about 4 feet tall, with the central yellow tank being about 2.5 feet long. It is designed to be able to hover for up to 30 seconds. </p>



<p>The vehicle&#8217;s central yellow tank (composite with aluminum liner) was donated to our rocket team by an aviation refurbishing company, and in a previous life held nitrogen in a 757.</p>
</div>
</div>



<p>This means it is extremely lightweight and rated to hold very high pressures, which makes it perfect for a vehicle that is a flying tank with some valves and legs strapped on. The presence of this tank enabled this project, and 20+ seconds of flight on a propellant as inefficient as cold gas would not be possible otherwise.</p>



<p>While we&#8217;re all fairly experienced, a project this complex does not (and should not) get built right away after an initial design is completed. Instead, we have been working on validating different aspects of this vehicle separately, well before the vehicle build actually begins.</p>



<p>My contribution to the project has been: high-level design decisions, the CAD of the vehicle pictured above, <a href="https://pwspencer.com/2023/02/28/closed-loop-control-self-stabilizing-stick/">a self-stabilizing stick</a> to learn more about closed loop control basics, and a drone design intended to imitate the control characteristics (specifically, thrust to weight and angular acceleration caused by attitude thrusters) of the eventual vehicle. Drone CAD and assembled frame (electronics and code currently WIP) pictured below.</p>

<p><strong>Attitude control</strong></p>



<p>This has been the largest area of work thus far.  We started out the project by investigating different attitude thruster configurations (pitch/yaw thrusters in above image), and generated graphs of efficiency and relative thrust by angle of thrust (using two or more thrusters to pitch the vehicle in a certain direction).</p>

<p>After settling on an architecture (four valves/thrusters on top of the vehicle, and two on the side for roll control), we began writing a simulation program in MATLAB, which was able to inform us about required engine throttling ability (we initially wanted to pulse the main thruster for simplicity, but determined this was not feasible for landing the vehicle safely) and attitude thruster strength (needed much less thrust than expected). Simulation program pictured below.</p>

<p>My own stick and drone projects have also been a significant part of our investigation into attitude control.</p>



<p><strong>Valve design</strong></p>



<p>We decided to go with custom solenoid valves for our attitude thrusters due to the high weight and cost of commercial options, and a custom stepper motor-actuated spool valve for the main thruster mainly for cost reasons. The main valve design is complete and we hope to begin machining and testing soon.</p>

<p><strong>Leg design</strong></p>



<p>We designed and tested a subscale assembly of the planned leg design, CAD of which is pictured below.</p>

<p>Our qualitative testing led to added tensioning wires on the main vehicle design, hoping to keep the legs stable and the feet facing the ground while also being able to absorb the impact of landing.</p>



<p>We have also put initial design work into eddy current dampers to be able to tolerate less-than-perfect landings and be easily reusable (as compared to using a crushing damper).</p>

<p>This project is a subset of the Hopper project, <a href="https://pwspencer.com/2023/02/28/hopper/">more on that here</a>. I built this in September 2022. The purpose of this project was to get more experience with control systems.</p>



<p>I designed, built, programmed, and tuned all parts of this stick. It consists of a carbon fiber rod held in a joint, free to swivel. Attached to the rod is an IMU (BNO055) and compressed air nozzles (using shop compressed air) controlled by solenoid valves (manifold visible in picture below). A Raspberry Pi talks to the IMU and the solenoid valves (by way of a relay board) and runs control code.</p>

<div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow">
<p>The &#8220;nozzles&#8221; are just cap fittings with a hole drilled in them. They are secured to the stick by 3D printed brackets which are bolted to a laser-cut wood circle, which is then attached to the rod with another 3D printed bracket. The rod is clamped at the joint, instead of bolted, to allow for easy adjustment. The joint has four bearings, which lets the rod swivel smoothly on two axes. The joint is attached to 80/20 extrusion, which extends to a table where it is weighted down to keep everything upright. The rod also features attachment points to add mass, which is important to change the rod&#8217;s moment of inertia and thus its control characteristics. Changing MoI is the purpose of the large metal objects above and below the joint.</p>
</div>
</div>



<p>The solenoid valves are meant for use in irrigation (I chose them because of their very low cost), which somewhat limited the final control abilities of the stick: the minimum time the valves would stay open for was around a quarter second, and within that constraint the stabilization displayed in the video above is about as good as it got working, unless we ever swap in new valves (they are the bottleneck control-wise of the system). </p>



<p>The part of this project where I learned the most was the control code. I&#8217;d never done custom closed-loop control before, and in this project I programmed a PD loop (proportional + derivative) from the ground up in Python, without using any control libraries. If I redid this project, I would instead choose C because it is much more common for this type of application and it runs much faster. Python&#8217;s speed wasn&#8217;t a limitation in this case because the valves were so slow, but it&#8217;s just not really meant for this kind of application. </p>



<p>The IMU worked for this application, but not perfectly. The BNO055 is 9DOF (accel + gyro + mag), but I mainly just used the accelerometers. It did have some issues with forgetting settings and resetting sensor calibration, which I solved by just feeding it all of that information every few seconds. It also had a strange intermittent issue where two of it axes flipped with no discernible cause, obviously destroying the ability of the system to control itself. If I were to redo this project, I would probably choose a simpler IMU- some of the sensor fusion modes caused issues, and I didn&#8217;t really need the 9DOF capability.</p>



<p>All of my prints pretty much worked on the first try. I did have to reprint the part of the joint that interfaces with the aluminum extrusion because it was too small. The nozzles also worked well enough. It was possible to turn the compressed air wall valve and meter how much air came out, which helped with finding the sweet spot for good control. The tubing I initially chose was too flexible and would balloon a concerning amount with compressed air inside (the 100psi of the wall was way more than it was rated for), so I swapped it for more rigid, thicker-walled tubing which worked well but yanked on the rod more, which made control a bit tougher.</p>



<p>This stick imitated the control setup of our planned vehicle, pictured below, with cold gas (CO2) nozzles on top of the vehicle for attitude control.</p>

<p>Between Sept 2021 and Apr 2022, I was on the propulsion team (~5 people) for XL-1, Masten Space Systems&#8217;  NASA-contracted (through CLPS) lunar lander. I was in charge of routing and positioning most propulsion components inside the lander, including valves (various types), regulators, fittings, tubes, clamps, brackets, etc. I did this using Solidworks, and by coordinating with the structures, integration, and systems teams on topics like structural interfaces between propulsion and the vehicle, integration order and schedule, mass budgets, and everything else required to position the vehicle&#8217;s propulsion system in a way that would interfere the least with other systems, make vehicle integration the easiest, and be strong enough to survive the trip to the moon.</p>



<p>I learned a massive amount about fluid system design through being on the XL-1 team, including tube bend considerations, support/structural requirements, insulation, material compatibility, how to make assembly/fabrication easy both for single tube runs and entire assemblies, pressure drop considerations/line balancing, plumbing and instrumentation diagram design, and the art of making easily-modifiable CAD, both parts and assemblies.</p>



<p>This role taught me a massive amount about in-space propulsion, vehicle design, mission design, and of course fluid system design. However, the skill that I improved through this role that I have most appreciated is much less technical: communication. I constantly communicated with a wide variety of people, and disagreements were not uncommon. Because of this, I really learned the value of concise, clear, respectful communication, and how to employ it to get results. This skillset has been invaluable since my time at Masten, during which I captained my school&#8217;s 30-student rocket team through competing in the Spaceport America Cup to a finish in the top third of teams. </p>



<p>At Masten, I was also part of <a href="https://pwspencer.com/2023/02/28/xodiac-testing/">VTVL rocket testing</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m on the left in orange.</p>



<p>Between Sept &#8211; Nov 2021, I was a member of the testing team for Xodiac, Masten (now Astrobotic)&#8217;s testbed VTVL rocket. </p>



<p>I was on the test team for 6 total flights: 4 tethered to a forklift and 2 free. I performed various checkouts: valve operation (pictured above), torque stripes, leak, and electrical. I also armed the flight termination system and assisted with propellant and pressurant fill (including cryogenic), vehicle transportation, and test equipment preparation. Xodiac has 100+ completed launches and landings.</p>



<p>Xodiac&#8217;s test team was small, ranging between 5 and 10 people, so I was an important part of the team and relied on, as I relied on my coworkers. </p>



<p>This experience (and helping with various small-engine static fire tests) taught me a massive amount about test engineering and operating under tense, time-sensitive conditions, where a mistake could have cascading consequences. Thankfully, every test I was part of was a full success, but there were a lot of problems the team had to solve to get them all to that point.</p>



<p>For the flights I was involved in, Xodiac&#8217;s payload was ExoCam, which is a camera in a impact-resistant frame that can be ejected from landers close to the surface of a celestial body and record video of the landing. Its testing on Xodiac was aimed at demonstrating capability and working out kinks to prepare for eventually operating on the moon.</p>



<p>At Masten, I was also on the <a href="https://pwspencer.com/2023/02/28/xl-1/">propulsion team for the XL-1 lunar lander</a>.</p>

<p>This is the rocket that got me my Level 1 certification in May 2021. It is about 2&#8243; diameter, about 8&#8242; long, and around 5lbs. I call it Scrapheap because it was mostly built out of parts I found laying around unused in my rocket team&#8217;s workshop. Most of its length is empty tube, I just wanted to make a really long rocket.</p>



<p>I designed it in OpenRocket (design/simulation software), cut the fiberglass body tubes to size, epoxied on the plywood fins, machined a metal coupler, laser cut various internal plywood parts, set up the recovery system with proper parachutes and shock cord, and programmed the settings for the onboard electronics.</p>



<p>This was my first foray into rocketry. It had two altimeters and two parachutes. Looking back now, the name &#8220;Scrapheap&#8221; is even more applicable because of how awful the build quality was, but I didn&#8217;t know that at the time..</p>



<p>It flew once, to about 900&#8242;, and had a perfect flight in spite of a very rushed launch day. Launch video below.</p>

<p>This is the rocket that got me my Tripoli Level 2 certification in June 2021. I call it Prismatic. It is 4&#8243; diameter, ~40&#8243; long, and weighed about 7lbs ready for flight. It flew dual deploy (two parachutes) with three altimeters. The scarfed tube fin design is definitely unique-looking, which was my goal (it certainly isn&#8217;t optimal aerodynamically!). </p>



<p>To build it, I designed the rocket in OpenRocket (rocket design/flight simulation software), designed the nosecone and internal avionics bay in Solidworks, 3D printed them, cut tubes to size, laser cut various internal wood components, set up the recovery system (parachutes), and programmed the onboard electronics. The specific method of fin attachment present here is somewhat unique even among other tube-fin rocket designs.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, I don&#8217;t have video of its 2 flights, but they both went to around 3500&#8242; and both went perfectly. The first was on a J99 motor (average 99 newtons of thrust), which is special because it has a 10 second long burn, which it accomplishes by being an endburner. The second was a J200something and was fun but unremarkable. </p>



<p>Longburning motors are very cool. The J99 burn wasn&#8217;t finished even by the time the rocket was no longer visible. The flight went great, and even though it heavily weathercocked into the wind, the wind brought it almost right back to the launch pad.</p>



<p>On the other hand, the day was a bit of a trainwreck. I launched with only a few minutes left in the waiver, after taking the L2 test, because I showed up unprepared and took many hours to get to a launch-ready state. After I did the same thing for my L1 a month earlier. There&#8217;s nothing like experiencing two <em>extremely</em> hectic and stressful launch days to drill in the importance of checklists and prep.</p>
