                One of the great questions of our time is: just exactly how old is Stevie Wonder right now?
                We've all wondered it at one point or another. Until now, there was no easy way to find out:
                Painstaking calculations gave you a glimpse of the truth, but it would become inaccurate in
                a matter of seconds! But now, you can know the EXACT age of Stevie Wonder ALL THE TIME! Sit
                back and relax because you're in for a wild ride as you look at the information below: it only
                gets better as you go down the list! As you get near the end... remember to breathe!!!

                    Note: It is with great sadness that the author must disclose the fact that Stevie Wonder's birth date
                    is only known to the day (May 13, 1950). Extensive operations have been performed to ascertain a more accurate
                    time, but they have yielded nothing. This means that the above ages are only accurate to the day and the 
                    exact age of Stevie Wonder in seconds is shrouded in mystery; beyond the realm of our understanding. There is
                    even the chance that Stevie Wonder himself does not know his birth date to the second. We can only
                    hope that one day, our descendants might somehow come to know the exact birth date of Stevie Wonder, and thus will be
                    able to truly change the world.
